      <a id="pcregrep-1_sect1" name="pcregrep-1_sect1" shape="rect"> </a>

      <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

      <p><span class="command"><strong>pcregrep</strong></span>
      searches files for character patterns, in the same way as
      other grep commands do, but it uses the PCRE regular
      expression library to support patterns that are compatible
      with the regular expressions of Perl 5. See <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcrepattern.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcrepattern</span>(3)</span></a> for a full
      description of syntax and semantics of the regular
      expressions that PCRE supports.</p>

      <p>Patterns, whether supplied on the command line or in a
      separate file, are given without delimiters. For example:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
pcregrep Thursday /etc/motd
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>If you attempt to use delimiters (for example, by
      surrounding a pattern with slashes, as is common in Perl
      scripts), they are interpreted as part of the pattern. Quotes
      can of course be used to delimit patterns on the command line
      because they are interpreted by the shell, and indeed they
      are required if a pattern contains white space or shell
      metacharacters.</p>

      <p>The first argument that follows any option settings is
      treated as the single pattern to be matched when neither
      <code class="option">−e</code> nor <code class="option">−f</code> is present. Conversely, when one or
      both of these options are used to specify patterns, all
      arguments are treated as path names. At least one of
      <code class="option">−e</code>, <code class="option">−f</code>, or an argument pattern must be
      provided.</p>

      <p>If no files are specified, <span class="command"><strong>pcregrep</strong></span> reads the standard
      input. The standard input can also be referenced by a name
      consisting of a single hyphen. For example:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
pcregrep some-pattern /file1 - /file3
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>By default, each line that matches a pattern is copied to
      the standard output, and if there is more than one file, the
      file name is output at the start of each line, followed by a
      colon. However, there are options that can change how
      <span class="command"><strong>pcregrep</strong></span>
      behaves. In particular, the <code class="option">−M</code> option makes it possible to search
      for patterns that span line boundaries. What defines a line
      boundary is controlled by the <code class="option">−N</code> (<code class="option">−−newline</code>) option.</p>

      <p>Patterns are limited to 8K or BUFSIZ characters, whichever
      is the greater. BUFSIZ is defined in <code class="literal">&lt;</code><code class="filename">stdio.h</code><code class="literal">&gt;</code>
      When there is more than one pattern (specified by the use of
      <code class="option">−e</code> and/or <code class="option">−f</code>), each pattern is applied to each
      line in the order in which they are defined, except that all
      the <code class="option">−e</code> patterns are tried
      before the <code class="option">−f</code> patterns.</p>

      <p>By default, as soon as one pattern matches (or fails to
      match when <code class="option">−v</code> is used), no
      further patterns are considered. However, if <code class="option">−−colour</code> (or <code class="option">−−color</code>) is used to colour the
      matching substrings, or if <code class="option">−−only−matching</code>,
      <code class="option">−−file−offsets</code>,
      or <code class="option">−−line−offsets</code> is used to
      output only the part of the line that matched (either shown
      literally, or as an offset), scanning resumes immediately
      following the match, so that further matches on the same line
      can be found. If there are multiple patterns, they are all
      tried on the remainder of the line, but patterns that follow
      the one that matched are not tried on the earlier part of the
      line.</p>

      <p>This is the same behaviour as GNU grep, but it does mean
      that the order in which multiple patterns are specified can
      affect the output when one of the above options is used.</p>

      <p>Patterns that can match an empty string are accepted, but
      empty string matches are never recognized. An example is the
      pattern "(super)?(man)?", in which all components are
      optional. This pattern finds all occurrences of both "super"
      and "man"; the output differs from matching with "super|man"
      when only the matching substrings are being shown.</p>

      <p>If the <code class="constant">LC_ALL</code> or
      <code class="constant">LC_CTYPE</code> environment variable
      is set, <span class="command"><strong>pcregrep</strong></span> uses the value to
      set a locale when calling the PCRE library. The <code class="option">−−locale</code> option can be used to
      override this.</p>

    <div class="refsect1" title="SUPPORT FOR COMPRESSED FILES">
      <a id="pcregrep-1_sect2" name="pcregrep-1_sect2" shape="rect"> </a>

      <h2>SUPPORT FOR COMPRESSED FILES</h2>

      <p>It is possible to compile <span class="command"><strong>pcregrep</strong></span> so that it uses
      <span class="command"><strong>libz</strong></span> or
      <span class="command"><strong>libbz2</strong></span> to read
      files whose names end in <em class="replaceable"><code>.gz</code></em> or <em class="replaceable"><code>.bz2</code></em>, respectively. You can
      find out whether your binary has support for one or both of
      these file types by running it with the <code class="option">−−help</code> option. If the appropriate
      support is not present, files are treated as plain text. The
      standard input is always so treated.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="refsect1" title="OPTIONS">
      <a id="pcregrep-1_sect3" name="pcregrep-1_sect3" shape="rect"> </a>

      <h2>OPTIONS</h2>

      <p>The order in which some of the options appear can affect
      the output. For example, both the <code class="option">−h</code> and <code class="option">−l</code> options affect the printing of file
      names. Whichever comes later in the command line will be the
      one that takes effect.</p>

      <div class="variablelist">
        <dl>
          <dt><span class="term"><code class="option">−−</code></span></dt>

          <dd>
            <p>This terminate the list of options. It is useful if
            the next item on the command line starts with a hyphen
            but is not an option. This allows for the processing of
            patterns and filenames that start with hyphens.</p>
          </dd>

          <dt><span class="term"><code class="option">−A</code> <em class="parameter"><code>number</code></em>, <code class="option">−−after−context=</code><em class="parameter"><code>number</code></em></span></dt>

          <dd>
            <p>Output <em class="parameter"><code>number</code></em> lines of context
            after each matching line. If filenames and/or line
            numbers are being output, a hyphen separator is used
            instead of a colon for the context lines. A line
            containing "--" is output between each group of lines,
            unless they are in fact contiguous in the input file.
            The value of <em class="parameter"><code>number</code></em> is expected to be
            relatively small. However, <span class="command"><strong>pcregrep</strong></span> guarantees
            to have up to 8K of following text available for
            context output.</p>
          </dd>

          <dt><span class="term"><code class="option">−B</code> <em class="parameter"><code>number</code></em>, <code class="option">−−before−context=</code><em class="parameter"><code>number</code></em></span></dt>

            unless they are in fact contiguous in the input file.
            The value of <em class="parameter"><code>number</code></em> is expected to be
            relatively small. However, <span class="command"><strong>pcregrep</strong></span> guarantees
            to have up to 8K of preceding text available for
            context output.</p>

          <dd>
            <p>Output <em class="parameter"><code>number</code></em> lines of context
            both before and after each matching line. This is
            equivalent to setting both <code class="option">−A</code> and <code class="option">−B</code> to the same value.</p>
          </dd>

          <dt><span class="term"><code class="option">−c</code>, <code class="option">−−count</code></span></dt>

          <dd>
            <p>Do not output individual lines from the files that
            are being scanned; instead output the number of lines
            that would otherwise have been shown. If no lines are
            selected, the number zero is output. If several files
            are are being scanned, a count is output for each of
            them. However, if the <code class="option">−−files−with−matches</code>
            option is also used, only those files whose counts are
            greater than zero are listed. When <code class="option">−c</code> is used, the <code class="option">−A</code>, <code class="option">−B</code>, and <code class="option">−C</code> options are ignored.</p>
          </dd>

          <dt><span class="term"><code class="option">−−colour</code>, <code class="option">−−color</code></span></dt>

          <dd>
            <p>If this option is given without any data, it is
            equivalent to "--colour=auto". If data is required, it
            must be given in the same shell item, separated by an
            equals sign.</p>
          </dd>

          <dt><span class="term"><code class="option">−−colour=</code><em class="parameter"><code>value</code></em>, <code class="option">−−color=</code><em class="parameter"><code>value</code></em></span></dt>

          <dd>
            <p>This option specifies under what circumstances the
            parts of a line that matched a pattern should be
            coloured in the output. By default, the output is not
            coloured. The value (which is optional, see above) may
            be "never", "always", or "auto". In the latter case,
            colouring happens only if the standard output is
            connected to a terminal. More resources are used when
            colouring is enabled, because <span class="command"><strong>pcregrep</strong></span> has to
            search for all possible matches in a line, not just
            one, in order to colour them all.</p>

            <p>The colour that is used can be specified by setting
            the environment variable PCREGREP_COLOUR or
            PCREGREP_COLOR. The value of this variable should be a
            string of two numbers, separated by a semicolon. They
            are copied directly into the control string for setting
            colour on a terminal, so it is your responsibility to
            ensure that they make sense. If neither of the
            environment variables is set, the default is "1;31",
            which gives red.</p>

            <p>If an input path is not a regular file or a

            default), "recurse" (equivalent to the <code class="option">−r</code> option), or "skip" (silently
            skip the path). In the default case, directories are
            read as if they were ordinary files. In some operating

            <p>Specify a pattern to be matched. This option can be
            used multiple times in order to specify several
            patterns. It can also be used as a way of specifying a
            single pattern that starts with a hyphen. When
            <code class="option">−e</code> is used, no
            argument pattern is taken from the command line; all
            arguments are treated as file names. There is an
            overall maximum of 100 patterns. They are applied to
            each line in the order in which they are defined until
            one matches (or fails to match if <code class="option">−v</code> is used). If <code class="option">−f</code> is used with <code class="option">−e</code>, the command line patterns are
            matched first, followed by the patterns from the file,
            independent of the order in which these options are
            specified. Note that multiple use of <code class="option">−e</code> is not the same as a single
            pattern with alternatives. For example, X|Y finds the
            first character in a line that is X or Y, whereas if
            the two patterns are given separately, <span class="command"><strong>pcregrep</strong></span> finds X if
            it is present, even if it follows Y in the line. It
            finds Y only if there is no X in the line. This really
            matters only if you are using <code class="option">−o</code> to show the part(s) of the
            line that matched.</p>

            require a very large amount of memory, leading in some
            cases to a program crash if not enough is available.
            Other patterns may take a very long time to search for
            all possible matching strings. The <code class="function">pcre_exec</code>() function that is called
            by <span class="command"><strong>pcregrep</strong></span> to do the
            matching has two parameters that can limit the
            resources that it uses.</p>

            <p>The <code class="option">−−match−limit</code> option
            provides a means of limiting resource usage when
            processing patterns that are not going to match, but
            which have a very large number of possibilities in
            their search trees. The classic example is a pattern
            that uses nested unlimited repeats. Internally, PCRE
            uses a function called <code class="function">match</code>() which it calls repeatedly
            (sometimes recursively). The limit set by <code class="option">−−match−limit</code> is
            imposed on the number of times this function is called
            during a match, which has the effect of limiting the
            amount of backtracking that can take place.</p>

            <p>The <code class="option">−−recursion−limit</code>
            option is similar to <code class="option">−−match−limit</code>, but
            instead of limiting the total number of times that
            <code class="function">match</code>() is called, it
            limits the depth of recursive calls, which in turn
            limits the amount of memory that can be used. The
            recursion depth is a smaller number than the total
            number of calls, because not all calls to <code class="function">match</code>() are recursive. This limit is
            of use only if it is set smaller than <code class="option">−−match−limit</code>.</p>

            <p>There are no short forms for these options. The
            default settings are specified when the PCRE library is
            compiled, with the default default being 10
            million.</p>

            may consist of more than one line, the last of which is
            the one in which the match ended. If the matched string
            ends with a newline sequence the output ends at the end
            of that line.</p>

            <p>When this option is set, the PCRE library is called

            buffers the input file as it scans it. However,
            <span class="command"><strong>pcregrep</strong></span>
            ensures that at least 8K characters or the rest of the
            document (whichever is the shorter) are available for
            forward matching, and similarly the previous 8K
            characters (or all the previous characters, if fewer
            than 8K) are guaranteed to be available for lookbehind
            assertions. This option does not work when input is

            <p>The PCRE library supports five different conventions

            (linefeed), the two-character sequence CRLF, an
            "anycrlf" convention, which recognizes any of the
            preceding three types, and an "any" convention, in
            which any Unicode line ending sequence is assumed to
            end a line. The Unicode sequences are the three just
            mentioned, plus VT (vertical tab, U+000B), FF
            (formfeed, U+000C), NEL (next line, U+0085), LS (line

            U+2029).</p>

            <p>When the PCRE library is built, a default
            line-ending sequence is specified. This is normally the

            library's default. The possible values for this option
            are CR, LF, CRLF, ANYCRLF, or ANY. This makes it
            possible to use <span class="command"><strong>pcregrep</strong></span> on files
            that have come from other environments without having
            to modify their line endings. If the data that is being

      <code class="option">−−include−dir</code>,
      <code class="option">−−line−offsets</code>,
      <code class="option">−−locale</code>,
      <code class="option">−−match−limit</code>,
      <code class="option">−M</code>, <code class="option">−−multiline</code>, <code class="option">−N</code>, <code class="option">−−newline</code>, <code class="option">−−recursion−limit</code>,
      <code class="option">−u</code>, and <code class="option">−−utf−8</code> options are
      specific to <span class="command"><strong>pcregrep</strong></span>, as is the use of
      the <code class="option">−−only−matching</code> option with
      a capturing parentheses number.</p>

      <p>Although most of the common options work the same way, a
      few are different in <span class="command"><strong>pcregrep</strong></span>. For example, the
      <code class="option">−−include</code> option's
      argument is a glob for GNU <span class="command"><strong>grep</strong></span>, but a regular
      expression for <span class="command"><strong>pcregrep</strong></span>. If both the
      <code class="option">−c</code> and <code class="option">−l</code> options are given, GNU grep lists
      only file names, without counts, but <span class="command"><strong>pcregrep</strong></span> gives the
      counts.</p>

    <div class="refsect1" title="OPTIONS WITH DATA">
      <a id="pcregrep-1_sect7" name="pcregrep-1_sect7" shape="rect"> </a>

      <h2>OPTIONS WITH DATA</h2>

      <p>There are four different ways in which an option with data
      can be specified. If a short form option is used, the data
      may follow immediately, or (with one exception) in the next
      command line item. For example:</p>

      <div class="variablelist">
        <dl>
          <dt><span class="term"><code class="option">−f</code>/some/file, <code class="option">−f</code> /some/file</span></dt>

          <dd>
            <p>The exception is the <code class="option">−o</code> option, which may appear with
            or without data. Because of this, if data is present,
            it must follow immediately in the same item, for
            example -o3.</p>
          </dd>
        </dl>
      </div>

      <p>If a long form option is used, the data may appear in the
      same command line item, separated by an equals character, or
      (with two exceptions) it may appear in the next command line
      item. For example:</p>

      <div class="variablelist">
        <dl>
          <dt><span class="term"><code class="option">−f</code>/some/file, <code class="option">−f</code> /some/file</span></dt>

          <dd>
            <p>Note, however, that if you want to supply a file
            name beginning with ~ as data in a shell command, and
            have the shell expand ~ to a home directory, you must
            separate the file name from the option, because the
            shell does not treat ~ specially unless it is at the
            start of an item.</p>
          </dd>
        </dl>
      </div>

      <p>The exceptions to the above are the <code class="option">−−colour</code> (or <code class="option">−−color</code>) and <code class="option">−−only−matching</code> options,
      for which the data is optional. If one of these options does
      have data, it must be given in the first form, using an
      equals character. Otherwise <span class="command"><strong>pcregrep</strong></span> will assume that
      it has no data.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="refsect1" title="MATCHING ERRORS">
      <a id="pcregrep-1_sect8" name="pcregrep-1_sect8" shape="rect"> </a>

      <h2>MATCHING ERRORS</h2>

      <p>It is possible to supply a regular expression that takes a
      very long time to fail to match certain lines. Such patterns
      normally involve nested indefinite repeats, for example:
      (a+)*\d when matched against a line of a's with no final
      digit. The PCRE matching function has a resource limit that
      causes it to abort in these circumstances. If this happens,
      <span class="command"><strong>pcregrep</strong></span>
      outputs an error message and the line that caused the problem
      to the standard error stream. If there are more than 20 such
      errors, <span class="command"><strong>pcregrep</strong></span> gives up.</p>

      <p>The <code class="option">−−match−limit</code> option of
      <span class="command"><strong>pcregrep</strong></span> can be
      used to set the overall resource limit; there is a second
      option called <code class="option">−−recursion−limit</code> that sets
      a limit on the amount of memory (usually stack) that is used
      (see the discussion of these options above).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="refsect1" title="DIAGNOSTICS">
      <a id="pcregrep-1_sect9" name="pcregrep-1_sect9" shape="rect"> </a>

      <h2>DIAGNOSTICS</h2>

      <p>Exit status is 0 if any matches were found, 1 if no
      matches were found, and 2 for syntax errors and non-existent
      or inacessible files (even if matches were found in other
      files) or too many matching errors. Using the <code class="option">−s</code> option to suppress error messages
      about inaccessble files does not affect the return code.</p>
