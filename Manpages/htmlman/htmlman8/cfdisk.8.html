      <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

      <p><span class="command"><strong>cfdisk</strong></span> is a
      curses based program for partitioning any hard disk drive.
      Typical values of the <em class="parameter"><code>device</code></em> argument are:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
        /dev/hda [default]
        /dev/hdb
        /dev/sda
        /dev/sdb
        /dev/sdc
        /dev/sdd
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>In order to write the partition table <span class="command"><strong>cfdisk</strong></span> needs something
      called the `geometry' of the disk: the number of `heads' and
      the number of `sectors per track'. Linux does not use any
      geometry, so if the disk will not be accessed by other
      operating systems, you can safely accept the defaults that
      <span class="command"><strong>cfdisk</strong></span> chooses
      for you. The geometry used by <span class="command"><strong>cfdisk</strong></span> is found as follows.
      First the partition table is examined, to see what geometry
      was used by the previous program that changed it. If the
      partition table is empty, or contains garbage, or does not
      point at a consistent geometry, the kernel is asked for
      advice. If nothing works 255 heads and 63 sectors/track is
      assumed. The geometry can be overridden on the command line
      or by use of the `g' command. When partitioning an empty
      large modern disk, picking 255 heads and 63 sectors/track is
      always a good idea. There is no need to set the number of
      cylinders, since <span class="command"><strong>cfdisk</strong></span> knows the disk
      size.</p>

      <p>Next, <span class="command"><strong>cfdisk</strong></span>
      tries to read the current partition table from the disk
      drive. If it is unable to figure out the partition table, an
      error is displayed and the program will exit. This might also
      be caused by incorrect geometry information, and can be
      overridden on the command line. Another way around this
      problem is with the <code class="option">−z</code>
      option. This will ignore the partition table on the disk.</p>

      <p>The main display is composed of four sections, from top to
      bottom: the header, the partitions, the command line and a
      warning line. The header contains the program name and
      version number followed by the disk drive and its geometry.
      The partitions section always displays the current partition
      table. The command line is the place where commands and text
      are entered. The available commands are usually displayed in
      brackets. The warning line is usually empty except when there
      is important information to be displayed. The current
      partition is highlighted with reverse video (or an arrow if
      the <code class="option">−a</code> option is given).
      All partition specific commands apply to the current
      partition.</p>

      <p>The format of the partition table in the partitions
      section is, from left to right: Name, Flags, Partition Type,
      Filesystem Type and Size. The name is the partition device
      name. The flags can be <code class="literal">Boot</code>,
      which designates a bootable partition or <code class="constant">NC</code>, which stands for "Not Compatible with
      DOS or OS/2". DOS, OS/2 and possibly other operating systems
      require the first sector of the first partition on the disk
      and all logical partitions to begin on the second head. This
      wastes the second through the last sector of the first track
      of the first head (the first sector is taken by the partition
      table itself). <span class="command"><strong>cfdisk</strong></span> allows you to
      recover these "lost" sectors with the maximize command
      (<code class="literal">m</code>). <em class="replaceable"><code>Note:</code></em> <a class="link" href="../htmlman8/fdisk.8.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">fdisk</span>(8)</span></a> and some early
      versions of DOS create all partitions with the number of
      sectors already maximized. For more information, see the
      maximize command below. The partition type can be one of
      <code class="literal">Primary</code> or <code class="literal">Logical</code>. For unallocated space on the drive,
      the partition type can also be <code class="literal">Pri/Log</code>, or empty (if the space is
      unusable). The filesystem type section displays the name of
      the filesystem used on the partition, if known. If it is
      unknown, then <code class="literal">Unknown</code> and the
      hex value of the filesystem type are displayed. A special
      case occurs when there are sections of the disk drive that
      cannot be used (because all of the primary partitions are
      used). When this is detected, the filesystem type is
      displayed as <code class="literal">Unusable</code>. The size
      field displays the size of the partition in megabytes (by
      default). It can also display the size in sectors and
      cylinders (see the change units command below). If an
      asterisk (<code class="literal">*</code>) appears after the
      size, this means that the partition is not aligned on
      cylinder boundaries.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="refsect1" title="DOS 6.x WARNING">
      <a id="cfdisk-8_sect2" name="cfdisk-8_sect2" shape="rect"> </a>

      <h2>DOS 6.x WARNING</h2>

      <p>The DOS 6.x FORMAT command looks for some information in
      the first sector of the data area of the partition, and
      treats this information as more reliable than the information
      in the partition table. DOS FORMAT expects DOS FDISK to clear
      the first 512 bytes of the data area of a partition whenever
      a size change occurs. DOS FORMAT will look at this extra
      information even if the /U flag is given -- we consider this
      a bug in DOS FORMAT and DOS FDISK.</p>

      <p>The bottom line is that if you use cfdisk or fdisk to
      change the size of a DOS partition table entry, then you must
      also use <span class="command"><strong>dd</strong></span> to
      zero the first 512 bytes of that partition before using DOS
      FORMAT to format the partition. For example, if you were
      using cfdisk to make a DOS partition table entry for
      /dev/hda1, then (after exiting fdisk or cfdisk and rebooting
      Linux so that the partition table information is valid) you
      would use the command "dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/hda1 bs=512
      count=1" to zero the first 512 bytes of the partition.
      Note:</p>

      <p><span class="emphasis"><em>BE EXTREMELY
      CAREFUL</em></span> if you use the <span class="command"><strong>dd</strong></span> command, since a small
      typo can make all of the data on your disk useless.</p>

      <p>For best results, you should always use an OS-specific
      partition table program. For example, you should make DOS
      partitions with the DOS FDISK program and Linux partitions
      with the Linux fdisk or Linux cfdisk program.</p>

      <h2>COMMANDS</h2>

      <p><span class="command"><strong>cfdisk</strong></span>
      commands can be entered by pressing the desired key (pressing
      <span class="keycap"><strong>Enter</strong></span> after the
      command is not necessary). Here is a list of the available
      commands:</p>

      <div class="variablelist">

            <p>Delete the current partition. This will convert the
            current partition into free space and merge it with any
            free space immediately surrounding the current
            partition. A partition already marked as free space or
            marked as unusable cannot be deleted.</p>
          </dd>

          <dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">g</code></span></dt>

          <dd>
            <p>Change the disk geometry (cylinders, heads, or
            sectors-per-track). <em class="replaceable"><code>WARNING:</code></em> This option
            should only be used by people who know what they are
            doing. A command line option is also available to
            change the disk geometry. While at the change disk
            geometry command line, you can choose to change
            cylinders (<code class="option">c</code>), heads
            (<code class="option">h</code>), and sectors per track
            (<code class="option">s</code>). The default value will
            be printed at the prompt which you can accept by simply
            pressing the <span class="keycap"><strong>Enter</strong></span> key, or you can
            exit without changes by pressing the <span class="keycap"><strong>ESC</strong></span> key. If you want
            to change the default value, simply enter the desired
            value and press <span class="keycap"><strong>Enter</strong></span>. The altered
            disk parameter values do not take effect until you
            return to the main menu (by pressing <span class="keycap"><strong>Enter</strong></span> or <span class="keycap"><strong>ESC</strong></span> at the change disk
            geometry command line). If you change the geometry such
            that the disk appears larger, the extra sectors are
            added at the end of the disk as free space. If the disk
            appears smaller, the partitions that are beyond the new
            last sector are deleted and the last partition on the
            drive (or the free space at the end of the drive) is
            made to end at the new last sector.</p>

            <p>Maximize disk usage of the current partition. This
            command will recover the unused space between the
            partition table and the beginning of the partition, but
            at the cost of making the partition incompatible with
            DOS, OS/2 and possibly other operating systems. This
            option will toggle between maximal disk usage and DOS,
            OS/2, etc. compatible disk usage. The default when
            creating a partition is to create DOS, OS/2, etc.
            compatible partitions.</p>

            <p>Create new partition from free space. If the
            partition type is <code class="literal">Primary</code>
            or <code class="literal">Logical</code>, a partition of
            that type will be created, but if the partition type is
            <code class="literal">Pri/Log</code>, you will be
            prompted for the type you want to create. Be aware that
            (1) there are only four slots available for primary
            partitions and (2) since there can be only one extended
            partition, which contains all of the logical drives,
            all of the logical drives must be contiguous (with no
            intervening primary partition). <span class="command"><strong>cfdisk</strong></span> next prompts
            you for the size of the partition you want to create.
            The default size, equal to the entire free space of the
            current partition, is displayed in megabytes. You can
            either press the <span class="keycap"><strong>Enter</strong></span> key to accept
            the default size or enter a different size at the
            prompt. <span class="command"><strong>cfdisk</strong></span> accepts size
            entries in megabytes (<code class="constant">M</code>)
            [default], kilobytes (<code class="constant">K</code>),
            cylinders (<code class="constant">C</code>) and sectors
            (<code class="constant">S</code>) by entering the
            number immediately followed by one of (<code class="constant">M</code>, <code class="constant">K</code>,
            <code class="constant">C</code> or <code class="constant">S</code>). If the partition fills the free
            space available, the partition is created and you are
            returned to the main command line. Otherwise, the
            partition can be created at the beginning or the end of
            the free space, and <span class="command"><strong>cfdisk</strong></span> will ask you
            to choose where to place the partition. After the
            partition is created, <span class="command"><strong>cfdisk</strong></span> automatically
            adjusts the other partitions' partition types if all of
            the primary partitions are used.</p>

                would be written to disk if a <code class="literal">w</code>rite command is selected. First,
                the primary partition table is printed, followed by
                the partition tables associated with each logical
                partition. The data is printed in hex byte by byte
                with 16 bytes per line.</p>

                <p>The <span class="emphasis"><em>partition table

                fields, from left to right, are the number of the
                partition, the partition type, the first sector,
                the last sector, the offset from the first sector

                primary and logical partitions, free and unusable
                space is printed and the extended partition is
                printed before the first logical partition.</p>

                <p>If a partition does not start or end on a
                cylinder boundary or if the partition length is not

                (<code class="literal">*</code>) is printed after
                the non-aligned sector number/count. This usually
                indicates that a partition was created by an
                operating system that either does not align
                partitions to cylinder boundaries or that used
                different disk geometry information. If you know
                the disk geometry of the other operating system,

                <p>The <span class="emphasis"><em>partition table

                table ordered by partition number. It will leave
                out all free and unusable space. The fields, from
                left to right, are the number of the partition, the
                flags (in hex), the starting head, sector and
                cylinder, the filesystem ID (in hex), the ending

                <p>The partition table entries only have 10 bits
                available to represent the starting and ending
                cylinders. Thus, when the absolute starting
                (ending) sector number is on a cylinder greater
                than 1023, the maximal values for starting (ending)
                head, sector and cylinder are printed. This is the
                method used by OS/2, and thus fixes the problems
                associated with OS/2's fdisk rewriting the
                partition table when it is not in this format.
                Since Linux and OS/2 use absolute sector counts,
                the values in the starting and ending head, sector
                and cylinder are not used.</p>
