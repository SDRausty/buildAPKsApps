      <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

      <p><span class="command"><strong>hwclock</strong></span> is a
      tool for accessing the Hardware Clock. You can display the
      current time, set the Hardware Clock to a specified time, set
      the Hardware Clock to the System Time, and set the System
      Time from the Hardware Clock.</p>

      <p>You can also run <span class="command"><strong>hwclock</strong></span> periodically to
      insert or remove time from the Hardware Clock to compensate
      for systematic drift (where the clock consistently gains or
      loses time at a certain rate if left to run).</p>
    </div>

      <h2>FUNCTIONS</h2>

      <p>You need exactly one of the following options to tell
      <span class="command"><strong>hwclock</strong></span> what
      function to perform:</p>

      <div class="variablelist">
        <dl>
          <dt><span class="term"><code class="option">−r,
          −−show</code></span></dt>

          <dd>
            <p>Read the Hardware Clock and print the time on
            Standard Output. The time shown is always in local
            time, even if you keep your Hardware Clock in
            Coordinated Universal Time. See the <code class="option">−−utc</code> option.</p>
          </dd>

          <dt><span class="term"><code class="option">−−set</code></span></dt>

          <dd>
            <p>Set the Hardware Clock to the time given by the
            <code class="option">−−date</code>
            option.</p>
          </dd>

          <dt><span class="term"><code class="option">−s,
          −−hctosys</code></span></dt>

          <dd>
            <p>Set the System Time from the Hardware Clock.</p>

            <p>Also set the kernel's timezone value to the local
            timezone as indicated by the TZ environment variable
            and/or <code class="filename">/usr/share/zoneinfo</code>, as <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/tzset.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">tzset</span>(3)</span></a> would
            interpret them. The obsolete tz_dsttime field of the
            kernel's timezone value is set to DST_NONE. (For
            details on what this field used to mean, see <a class="link" href="../htmlman2/gettimeofday.2.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">settimeofday</span>(2)</span></a>.)</p>

            <p>This is a good option to use in one of the system
            startup scripts.</p>
          </dd>

          <dt><span class="term"><code class="option">−w,

          </dd>

          <dt><span class="term"><code class="option">−−systz</code></span></dt>

          <dd>
            <p>Reset the System Time based on the current
            timezone.</p>

            <p>Also set the kernel's timezone value to the local
            timezone as indicated by the TZ environment variable
            and/or <code class="filename">/usr/share/zoneinfo</code>, as <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/tzset.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">tzset</span>(3)</span></a> would
            interpret them. The obsolete tz_dsttime field of the
            kernel's timezone value is set to DST_NONE. (For

            <p>This is an alternate option to <code class="option">−−hctosys</code> that does not
            read the hardware clock, and may be used in system
            startup scripts for recent 2.6 kernels where you know
            the System Time contains the Hardware Clock time.</p>
          </dd>

          <dt><span class="term"><code class="option">−−adjust</code></span></dt>

          <dd>
            <p>Add or subtract time from the Hardware Clock to
            account for systematic drift since the last time the
            clock was set or adjusted. See discussion below.</p>
          </dd>

          <dt><span class="term"><code class="option">−−getepoch</code></span></dt>

          <dd>
            <p>Print the kernel's Hardware Clock epoch value to
            standard output. This is the number of years into AD to
            which a zero year value in the Hardware Clock refers.
            For example, if you are using the convention that the
            year counter in your Hardware Clock contains the number
            of full years since 1952, then the kernel's Hardware
            Counter epoch value must be 1952.</p>

            <p>This epoch value is used whenever hwclock reads or
            sets the Hardware Clock.</p>
          </dd>

          <dt><span class="term"><code class="option">−−setepoch</code></span></dt>

          <dd>
            <p>Set the kernel's Hardware Clock epoch value to the
            value specified by the <code class="option">−−epoch</code> option. See the
            <code class="option">−−getepoch</code>
            option for details.</p>
          </dd>

          <dt><span class="term"><code class="option">−v,

          <dd>
            <p>You need this option if you specify the <code class="option">−−set</code> option. Otherwise, it
            is ignored. This specifies the time to which to set the
            Hardware Clock. The value of this option is an argument
            to the <a class="link" href="../htmlman1/date.1.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">date</span>(1)</span></a> program. For

</pre>
            </div>

            <p>The argument is in local time, even if you keep your
            Hardware Clock in Coordinated Universal time. See the
            <code class="option">−−utc</code>

          <dt><span class="term"><code class="option">−−epoch=year</code></span></dt>

          <dd>
            <p>Specifies the year which is the beginning of the
            Hardware Clock's epoch. I.e. the number of years into
            AD to which a zero value in the Hardware Clock's year
            counter refers. It is used together with the
            −−setepoch option to set the kernel's idea
            of the epoch of the Hardware Clock, or otherwise to
            specify the epoch for use with direct ISA access.</p>

            <p>For example, on a Digital Unix machine:</p>

            <p><span class="emphasis"><em>hwclock --setepoch

            <code class="option">−−date</code> option
            based on the adjtime file. This is useful for example
            if you need to set an RTC wakeup time to distant future
            and want to account for the RTC drift.</p>

            <p>Indicates that the Hardware Clock is kept in
            Coordinated Universal Time or local time, respectively.
            It is your choice whether to keep your clock in UTC or
            local time, but nothing in the clock tells which you've
            chosen. So this option is how you give that information
            to <span class="command"><strong>hwclock</strong></span>.</p>

            <p>If you specify the wrong one of these options (or
            specify neither and take a wrong default), both setting
            and querying of the Hardware Clock will be messed

            <p>If you specify neither <code class="option">−−utc</code> nor <code class="option">−−localtime</code> , the default

            (which implements enough of ISA to be, roughly
            speaking, an ISA machine for <span class="command"><strong>hwclock</strong></span>'s purposes).
            For other machines, it has no effect. This option tells
            <span class="command"><strong>hwclock</strong></span>
            to use explicit I/O instructions to access the Hardware
            Clock. Without this option, <span class="command"><strong>hwclock</strong></span> will try to
            use the /dev/rtc device (which it assumes to be driven
            by the rtc device driver). If it is unable to open the
            device (for read), it will use the explicit I/O
            instructions anyway.</p>

          <dd>
            <p>Indicates that the Hardware Clock is incapable of
            storing years outside the range 1994-1999. There is a
            problem in some BIOSes (almost all Award BIOSes made
            between 4/26/94 and 5/31/95) wherein they are unable to
            deal with years after 1999. If one attempts to set the
            year-of-century value to something less than 94 (or 95
            in some cases), the value that actually gets set is 94
            (or 95). Thus, if you have one of these machines,
            <span class="command"><strong>hwclock</strong></span>
            cannot set the year after 1999 and cannot use the value
            of the clock as the true time in the normal way.</p>

            <p>To compensate for this (without your getting a BIOS
            update, which would definitely be preferable), always
            use <code class="option">−−badyear</code>
            if you have one of these machines. When <span class="command"><strong>hwclock</strong></span> knows it's
            working with a brain-damaged clock, it ignores the year
            part of the Hardware Clock value and instead tries to
            guess the year based on the last calibrated date in the
            adjtime file, by assuming that that date is within the
            past year. For this to work, you had better do a
            <span class="emphasis"><em>hwclock
            −−set</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>hwclock
            −−systohc</em></span> at least once a
            year!</p>

            <p>Though <span class="command"><strong>hwclock</strong></span> ignores the
            year value when it reads the Hardware Clock, it sets
            the year value when it sets the clock. It sets it to
            1995, 1996, 1997, or 1998, whichever one has the same
            position in the leap year cycle as the true year. That
            way, the Hardware Clock inserts leap days where they
            belong. Again, if you let the Hardware Clock run for
            more than a year without setting it, this scheme could
            be defeated and you could end up losing a day.</p>

            <p><span class="command"><strong>hwclock</strong></span> warns you
            that you probably need <code class="option">−−badyear</code> whenever it finds
            your Hardware Clock set to 1994 or 1995.</p>

      <h2>Clocks in a Linux System</h2>

      <p>There are two main clocks in a Linux system:</p>

      <p><span class="emphasis"><em>The Hardware Clock:</em></span>
      This is a clock that runs independently of any control
      program running in the CPU and even when the machine is
      powered off.</p>

      <p>On an ISA system, this clock is specified as part of the
      ISA standard. The control program can read or set this clock
      to a whole second, but the control program can also detect
      the edges of the 1 second clock ticks, so the clock actually
      has virtually infinite precision.</p>

      <p>This clock is commonly called the hardware clock, the real
      time clock, the RTC, the BIOS clock, and the CMOS clock.
      Hardware Clock, in its capitalized form, was coined for use
      by <span class="command"><strong>hwclock</strong></span>
      because all of the other names are inappropriate to the point
      of being misleading.</p>

      <p>So for example, some non-ISA systems have a few real time
      clocks with only one of them having its own power domain. A
      very low power external I2C or SPI clock chip might be used
      with a backup battery as the hardware clock to initialize a
      more functional integrated real-time clock which is used for
      most other purposes.</p>

      <p><span class="emphasis"><em>The System Time:</em></span>
      This is the time kept by a clock inside the Linux kernel and
      driven by a timer interrupt. (On an ISA machine, the timer
      interrupt is part of the ISA standard). It has meaning only
      while Linux is running on the machine. The System Time is the
      number of seconds since 00:00:00 January 1, 1970 UTC (or more
      succinctly, the number of seconds since 1969). The System
      Time is not an integer, though. It has virtually infinite
      precision.</p>

      <p>The System Time is the time that matters. The Hardware
      Clock's basic purpose in a Linux system is to keep time when
      Linux is not running. You initialize the System Time to the
      time from the Hardware Clock when Linux starts up, and then
      never use the Hardware Clock again. Note that in DOS, for
      which ISA was designed, the Hardware Clock is the only real
      time clock.</p>

      <p>It is important that the System Time not have any
      discontinuities such as would happen if you used the
      <span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">date</span>(1L)</span> program to set it
      while the system is running. You can, however, do whatever
      you want to the Hardware Clock while the system is running,
      and the next time Linux starts up, it will do so with the
      adjusted time from the Hardware Clock. You can also use the
      program <span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">adjtimex</span>(8)</span> to smoothly adjust
      the System Time while the system runs.</p>

      <p>A Linux kernel maintains a concept of a local timezone for
      the system. But don't be misled -- almost nobody cares what
      timezone the kernel thinks it is in. Instead, programs that
      care about the timezone (perhaps because they want to display
      a local time for you) almost always use a more traditional
      method of determining the timezone: They use the TZ
      environment variable and/or the <code class="filename">/usr/share/zoneinfo</code> directory, as explained
      in the man page for <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/tzset.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">tzset</span>(3)</span></a>. However, some
      programs and fringe parts of the Linux kernel such as
      filesystems use the kernel timezone value. An example is the
      vfat filesystem. If the kernel timezone value is wrong, the
      vfat filesystem will report and set the wrong timestamps on
      files.</p>

      <p><span class="command"><strong>hwclock</strong></span> sets
      the kernel timezone to the value indicated by TZ and/or
      <code class="filename">/usr/share/zoneinfo</code> when you
      set the System Time using the <code class="option">−−hctosys</code> option.</p>

      <p>The timezone value actually consists of two parts: 1) a
      field tz_minuteswest indicating how many minutes local time
      (not adjusted for DST) lags behind UTC, and 2) a field
      tz_dsttime indicating the type of Daylight Savings Time (DST)
      convention that is in effect in the locality at the present
      time. This second field is not used under Linux and is always
      zero. (See also <a class="link" href="../htmlman2/gettimeofday.2.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">settimeofday</span>(2)</span></a>.)</p>

      <a id="hwclock-8_sect6" name="hwclock-8_sect6" shape="rect"> </a>

      <h2>How hwclock Accesses the Hardware Clock</h2>

      <p><span class="command"><strong>hwclock</strong></span> uses
      many different ways to get and set Hardware Clock values. The
      most normal way is to do I/O to the device special file
      /dev/rtc, which is presumed to be driven by the rtc device
      driver. However, this method is not always available. For one
      thing, the rtc driver is a relatively recent addition to
      Linux. Older systems don't have it. Also, though there are
      versions of the rtc driver that work on DEC Alphas, there
      appear to be plenty of Alphas on which the rtc driver does
      not work (a common symptom is hwclock hanging). Moreover,
      recent Linux systems have more generic support for RTCs, even
      systems that have more than one, so you might need to
      override the default by specifying <code class="filename">/dev/rtc0</code> or <code class="filename">/dev/rtc1</code> instead.</p>

      <p>On older systems, the method of accessing the Hardware
      Clock depends on the system hardware.</p>

      <p>On an ISA system, <span class="command"><strong>hwclock</strong></span> can directly access
      the "CMOS memory" registers that constitute the clock, by
      doing I/O to Ports 0x70 and 0x71. It does this with actual
      I/O instructions and consequently can only do it if running
      with superuser effective userid. (In the case of a Jensen
      Alpha, there is no way for <span class="command"><strong>hwclock</strong></span> to execute those
      I/O instructions, and so it uses instead the /dev/port device
      special file, which provides almost as low-level an interface
      to the I/O subsystem).</p>

      <p>This is a really poor method of accessing the clock, for
      all the reasons that user space programs are generally not
      supposed to do direct I/O and disable interrupts. Hwclock
      provides it because it is the only method available on ISA
      and Alpha systems which don't have working rtc device drivers
      available.</p>

      <p>On an m68k system, <span class="command"><strong>hwclock</strong></span> can access the
      clock via the console driver, via the device special file
      /dev/tty1.</p>

      <p><span class="command"><strong>hwclock</strong></span>
      tries to use /dev/rtc. If it is compiled for a kernel that
      doesn't have that function or it is unable to open /dev/rtc
      (or the alternative special file you've defined on the
      command line) <span class="command"><strong>hwclock</strong></span> will fall back to
      another method, if available. On an ISA or Alpha machine, you
      can force <span class="command"><strong>hwclock</strong></span> to use the direct
      manipulation of the CMOS registers without even trying
      <code class="filename">/dev/rtc</code> by specifying the
      <code class="option">−−directisa</code>
      option.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="refsect1" title="The Adjust Function">
      <a id="hwclock-8_sect7" name="hwclock-8_sect7" shape="rect"> </a>

      <h2>The Adjust Function</h2>

      <p>The Hardware Clock is usually not very accurate. However,
      much of its inaccuracy is completely predictable - it gains
      or loses the same amount of time every day. This is called
      systematic drift. <span class="command"><strong>hwclock</strong></span>'s "adjust" function
      lets you make systematic corrections to correct the
      systematic drift.</p>

      <p>It works like this: <span class="command"><strong>hwclock</strong></span> keeps a file,
      <code class="filename">/etc/adjtime</code>, that keeps some
      historical information. This is called the adjtime file.</p>

      <p>Suppose you start with no adjtime file. You issue a
      <span class="emphasis"><em>hwclock
      −−set</em></span> command to set the Hardware
      Clock to the true current time. <span class="command"><strong>Hwclock</strong></span> creates the adjtime
      file and records in it the current time as the last time the
      clock was calibrated. 5 days later, the clock has gained 10
      seconds, so you issue another <span class="emphasis"><em>hwclock −−set</em></span> command
      to set it back 10 seconds. <span class="command"><strong>Hwclock</strong></span> updates the adjtime
      file to show the current time as the last time the clock was
      calibrated, and records 2 seconds per day as the systematic
      drift rate. 24 hours go by, and then you issue a <span class="emphasis"><em>hwclock −−adjust</em></span>
      command. <span class="command"><strong>Hwclock</strong></span> consults the
      adjtime file and sees that the clock gains 2 seconds per day
      when left alone and that it has been left alone for exactly
      one day. So it subtracts 2 seconds from the Hardware Clock.
      It then records the current time as the last time the clock
      was adjusted. Another 24 hours goes by and you issue another
      <span class="emphasis"><em>hwclock
      −−adjust</em></span>. <span class="command"><strong>Hwclock</strong></span> does the same
      thing: subtracts 2 seconds and updates the adjtime file with
      the current time as the last time the clock was adjusted.</p>

      <p>Every time you calibrate (set) the clock (using
      <code class="option">−−set</code> or <code class="option">−−systohc</code>), <span class="command"><strong>hwclock</strong></span> recalculates the
      systematic drift rate based on how long it has been since the
      last calibration, how long it has been since the last
      adjustment, what drift rate was assumed in any intervening
      adjustments, and the amount by which the clock is presently
      off.</p>

      <p>A small amount of error creeps in any time <span class="command"><strong>hwclock</strong></span> sets the clock, so
      it refrains from making an adjustment that would be less than
      1 second. Later on, when you request an adjustment again, the
      accumulated drift will be more than a second and <span class="command"><strong>hwclock</strong></span> will do the
      adjustment then.</p>

      <p>It is good to do a <span class="emphasis"><em>hwclock
      −−adjust</em></span> just before the <span class="emphasis"><em>hwclock −−hctosys</em></span> at
      system startup time, and maybe periodically while the system
      is running via cron.</p>

      <p>The adjtime file, while named for its historical purpose
      of controlling adjustments only, actually contains other
      information for use by hwclock in remembering information
      from one invocation to the next.</p>

      <p>The format of the adjtime file is, in ASCII:</p>

      <p>Line 1: 3 numbers, separated by blanks: 1) systematic
      drift rate in seconds per day, floating point decimal; 2)
      Resulting number of seconds since 1969 UTC of most recent
      adjustment or calibration, decimal integer; 3) zero (for
      compatibility with <span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">clock</span>(8)</span>) as a decimal
      integer.</p>

      <p>Line 2: 1 number: Resulting number of seconds since 1969
      UTC of most recent calibration. Zero if there has been no
      calibration yet or it is known that any previous calibration
      is moot (for example, because the Hardware Clock has been
      found, since that calibration, not to contain a valid time).
      This is a decimal integer.</p>

      <p>Line 3: "UTC" or "LOCAL". Tells whether the Hardware Clock
      is set to Coordinated Universal Time or local time. You can
      always override this value with options on the <span class="command"><strong>hwclock</strong></span> command line.</p>

      <p>You can use an adjtime file that was previously used with
      the <span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">clock</span>(8)</span> program with
      <span class="command"><strong>hwclock</strong></span>.</p>

    <div class="refsect1" title="Automatic Hardware Clock Synchronization By the Kernel">
      <a id="hwclock-8_sect8" name="hwclock-8_sect8" shape="rect"> </a>

      <h2>Automatic Hardware Clock Synchronization By the
      Kernel</h2>

      <p>You should be aware of another way that the Hardware Clock
      is kept synchronized in some systems. The Linux kernel has a
      mode wherein it copies the System Time to the Hardware Clock
      every 11 minutes. This is a good mode to use when you are
      using something sophisticated like ntp to keep your System
      Time synchronized. (ntp is a way to keep your System Time
      synchronized either to a time server somewhere on the network
      or to a radio clock hooked up to your system. See RFC
      1305).</p>

      <p>This mode (we'll call it "11 minute mode") is off until
      something turns it on. The ntp daemon xntpd is one thing that
      turns it on. You can turn it off by running anything,
      including <span class="emphasis"><em>hwclock
      −−hctosys</em></span>, that sets the System Time
      the old fashioned way.</p>

      <p>To see if it is on or off, use the command <span class="emphasis"><em>adjtimex −−print</em></span> and
      look at the value of "status". If the "64" bit of this number
      (expressed in binary) equal to 0, 11 minute mode is on.
      Otherwise, it is off.</p>

      <p>If your system runs with 11 minute mode on, don't use
      <span class="emphasis"><em>hwclock
      −−adjust</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>hwclock −−hctosys</em></span>.
      You'll just make a mess. It is acceptable to use a
      <span class="emphasis"><em>hwclock
      −−hctosys</em></span> at startup time to get a
      reasonable System Time until your system is able to set the
      System Time from the external source and start 11 minute
      mode.</p>

      <a id="hwclock-8_sect9" name="hwclock-8_sect9" shape="rect"> </a>

      <h2>ISA Hardware Clock Century value</h2>

      <p>There is some sort of standard that defines CMOS memory
      Byte 50 on an ISA machine as an indicator of what century it
      is. <span class="command"><strong>hwclock</strong></span>
      does not use or set that byte because there are some machines
      that don't define the byte that way, and it really isn't
      necessary anyway, since the year-of-century does a good job
      of implying which century it is.</p>

      <p>If you have a bona fide use for a CMOS century byte,
      contact the <span class="command"><strong>hwclock</strong></span> maintainer; an
      option may be appropriate.</p>

      <p>Note that this section is only relevant when you are using
      the "direct ISA" method of accessing the Hardware Clock. ACPI
      provides a standard way to access century values, when they
      are supported by the hardware.</p>
