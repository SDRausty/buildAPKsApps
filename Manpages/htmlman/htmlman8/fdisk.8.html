    <div class="refsect1" title="DESCRIPTION">
      <a id="fdisk-8_sect1" name="fdisk-8_sect1" shape="rect"> </a>

      <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

      <p><span class="command"><strong>fdisk</strong></span> (in
      the first form of invocation) is a menu-driven program for
      creation and manipulation of partition tables. It understands
      DOS-type partition tables and BSD- or SUN-type
      disklabels.</p>

      <p><span class="command"><strong>fdisk</strong></span> does
      not understand GUID partition tables (GPTs) and it is not
      designed for large partitions. In these cases, use the more
      advanced GNU <span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">parted</span>(8)</span>.</p>

      <p><span class="command"><strong>fdisk</strong></span> does
      not use DOS-compatible mode and cylinders as display units by
      default. The old deprecated DOS behavior can be enabled with
      the '-c=dos -u=cylinders' command-line options.</p>

      <p>Hard disks can be divided into one or more logical disks
      called <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">partitions</span>”</span>. This division is
      recorded in the <span class="emphasis"><em>partition
      table</em></span>, found in sector 0 of the disk. (In the BSD
      world one talks about `disk slices' and a `disklabel'.)</p>

      <p>Linux needs at least one partition, namely for its root
      file system. It can use swap files and/or swap partitions,
      but the latter are more efficient. So, usually one will want
      a second Linux partition dedicated as swap partition. On
      Intel-compatible hardware, the BIOS that boots the system can
      often only access the first 1024 cylinders of the disk. For
      this reason people with large disks often create a third
      partition, just a few MB large, typically mounted on
      <code class="filename">/boot</code>, to store the kernel
      image and a few auxiliary files needed at boot time, so as to
      make sure that this stuff is accessible to the BIOS. There
      may be reasons of security, ease of administration and
      backup, or testing, to use more than the minimum number of
      partitions.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="refsect1" title="DEVICES">
      <a id="fdisk-8_sect2" name="fdisk-8_sect2" shape="rect"> </a>

      <h2>DEVICES</h2>

      <p>The <em class="parameter"><code>device</code></em> is
      usually /dev/sda, /dev/sdb or so. A device name refers to the
      entire disk. Old systems without libata (a library used
      inside the Linux kernel to support ATA host controllers and
      devices) make a difference between IDE and SCSI disks. In
      such cases the device name will be /dev/hd* (IDE) or /dev/sd*
      (SCSI).</p>

      <p>The <em class="parameter"><code>partition</code></em> is a
      device name followed by a partition number. For example,
      /dev/sda1 is the first partition on the first hard disk in
      the system. See also Linux kernel documentation (the
      Documentation/devices.txt file).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="refsect1" title="DISK LABELS">
      <a id="fdisk-8_sect3" name="fdisk-8_sect3" shape="rect"> </a>

      <h2>DISK LABELS</h2>

      <p>A BSD/SUN-type disklabel can describe 8 partitions, the
      third of which should be a `whole disk' partition. Do not
      start a partition that actually uses its first sector (like a
      swap partition) at cylinder 0, since that will destroy the
      disklabel.</p>

      <p>An IRIX/SGI-type disklabel can describe 16 partitions, the
      eleventh of which should be an entire `volume' partition,
      while the ninth should be labeled `volume header'. The volume
      header will also cover the partition table, i.e., it starts
      at block zero and extends by default over five cylinders. The
      remaining space in the volume header may be used by header
      directory entries. No partitions may overlap with the volume
      header. Also do not change its type or make some filesystem
      on it, since you will lose the partition table. Use this type
      of label only when working with Linux on IRIX/SGI machines or
      IRIX/SGI disks under Linux.</p>

      <p>A DOS-type partition table can describe an unlimited
      number of partitions. In sector 0 there is room for the
      description of 4 partitions (called `primary'). One of these
      may be an extended partition; this is a box holding logical
      partitions, with descriptors found in a linked list of
      sectors, each preceding the corresponding logical partitions.
      The four primary partitions, present or not, get numbers 1-4.
      Logical partitions start numbering from 5.</p>

      <p>In a DOS-type partition table the starting offset and the
      size of each partition is stored in two ways: as an absolute
      number of sectors (given in 32 bits), and as a
      Cylinders/Heads/Sectors triple (given in 10+8+6 bits). The
      former is OK -- with 512-byte sectors this will work up to 2
      TB. The latter has two problems. First, these C/H/S fields
      can be filled only when the number of heads and the number of
      sectors per track are known. And second, even if we know what
      these numbers should be, the 24 bits that are available do
      not suffice. DOS uses C/H/S only, Windows uses both, Linux
      never uses C/H/S.</p>

      <p>If possible, <span class="command"><strong>fdisk</strong></span> will obtain the disk
      geometry automatically. This is not necessarily the physical
      disk geometry (indeed, modern disks do not really have
      anything like a physical geometry, certainly not something
      that can be described in simplistic Cylinders/Heads/Sectors
      form), but it is the disk geometry that MS-DOS uses for the
      partition table.</p>

      <p>Usually all goes well by default, and there are no
      problems if Linux is the only system on the disk. However, if
      the disk has to be shared with other operating systems, it is
      often a good idea to let an fdisk from another operating
      system make at least one partition. When Linux boots it looks
      at the partition table, and tries to deduce what (fake)
      geometry is required for good cooperation with other
      systems.</p>

      <p>Whenever a partition table is printed out, a consistency
      check is performed on the partition table entries. This check
      verifies that the physical and logical start and end points
      are identical, and that each partition starts and ends on a
      cylinder boundary (except for the first partition).</p>

      <p>Some versions of MS-DOS create a first partition which
      does not begin on a cylinder boundary, but on sector 2 of the
      first cylinder. Partitions beginning in cylinder 1 cannot
      begin on a cylinder boundary, but this is unlikely to cause
      difficulty unless you have OS/2 on your machine.</p>

      <p>A sync() and an ioctl(BLKRRPART) (reread partition table
      from disk) are performed before exiting when the partition
      table has been updated. Long ago it used to be necessary to
      reboot after the use of fdisk. I do not think this is the
      case anymore -- indeed, rebooting too quickly might cause
      loss of not-yet-written data. Note that both the kernel and
      the disk hardware may buffer data.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="refsect1" title="DOS 6.x WARNING">
      <a id="fdisk-8_sect4" name="fdisk-8_sect4" shape="rect"> </a>

      <h2>DOS 6.x WARNING</h2>

      <p>The DOS 6.x FORMAT command looks for some information in
      the first sector of the data area of the partition, and
      treats this information as more reliable than the information
      in the partition table. DOS FORMAT expects DOS FDISK to clear
      the first 512 bytes of the data area of a partition whenever
      a size change occurs. DOS FORMAT will look at this extra
      information even if the /U flag is given -- we consider this
      a bug in DOS FORMAT and DOS FDISK.</p>

      <p>The bottom line is that if you use cfdisk or fdisk to
      change the size of a DOS partition table entry, then you must
      also use <span class="command"><strong>dd</strong></span> to
      zero the first 512 bytes of that partition before using DOS
      FORMAT to format the partition. For example, if you were
      using cfdisk to make a DOS partition table entry for
      /dev/sda1, then (after exiting fdisk or cfdisk and rebooting
      Linux so that the partition table information is valid) you
      would use the command "dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda1 bs=512
      count=1" to zero the first 512 bytes of the partition.</p>

      <p><span class="emphasis"><em>BE EXTREMELY
      CAREFUL</em></span> if you use the <span class="command"><strong>dd</strong></span> command, since a small
      typo can make all of the data on your disk useless.</p>

      <p>For best results, you should always use an OS-specific
      partition table program. For example, you should make DOS
      partitions with the DOS FDISK program and Linux partitions
      with the Linux fdisk or Linux cfdisk program.</p>

      <a id="fdisk-8_sect6" name="fdisk-8_sect6" shape="rect"> </a>

      <h2>BUGS</h2>

      <p>There are several *fdisk programs around. Each has its
      problems and strengths. Try them in the order <span class="command"><strong>cfdisk</strong></span>, <span class="command"><strong>fdisk</strong></span>, <span class="command"><strong>sfdisk</strong></span>. (Indeed,
      <span class="command"><strong>cfdisk</strong></span> is a
      beautiful program that has strict requirements on the
      partition tables it accepts, and produces high quality
      partition tables. Use it if you can. <span class="command"><strong>fdisk</strong></span> is a buggy program
      that does fuzzy things - usually it happens to produce
      reasonable results. Its single advantage is that it has some
      support for BSD disk labels and other non-DOS partition
      tables. Avoid it if you can. <span class="command"><strong>sfdisk</strong></span> is for hackers only
      -- the user interface is terrible, but it is more correct
      than fdisk and more powerful than both fdisk and cfdisk.
      Moreover, it can be used noninteractively.)</p>

      <p>These days there also is <span class="command"><strong>parted</strong></span>. The cfdisk
      interface is nicer, but parted does much more: it not only
      resizes partitions, but also the filesystems that live in
      them.</p>

      <p>The IRIX/SGI-type disklabel is currently not supported by
      the kernel. Moreover, IRIX/SGI header directories are not
      fully supported yet.</p>

      <p>The option `dump partition table to file' is missing.</p>
