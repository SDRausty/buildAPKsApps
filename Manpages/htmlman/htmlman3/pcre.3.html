      <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

      <p>The PCRE library is a set of functions that implement
      regular expression pattern matching using the same syntax and
      semantics as Perl, with just a few differences. Some features
      that appeared in Python and PCRE before they appeared in Perl
      are also available using the Python syntax, there is some
      support for one or two .NET and Oniguruma syntax items, and
      there is an option for requesting some minor changes that
      give better JavaScript compatibility.</p>

      <p>The current implementation of PCRE corresponds
      approximately with Perl 5.12, including support for UTF-8
      encoded strings and Unicode general category properties.
      However, UTF-8 and Unicode support has to be explicitly
      enabled; it is not the default. The Unicode tables correspond
      to Unicode release 5.2.0.</p>

      <p>In addition to the Perl-compatible matching function, PCRE
      contains an alternative function that matches the same
      compiled patterns in a different way. In certain
      circumstances, the alternative function has some advantages.
      For a discussion of the two matching algorithms, see the
      <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcrematching.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcrematching</span>(3)</span></a> page.</p>

      <p>PCRE is written in C and released as a C library. A number
      of people have written wrappers and interfaces of various
      kinds. In particular, Google Inc. have provided a
      comprehensive C++ wrapper. This is now included as part of
      the PCRE distribution. The <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcrecpp.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcrecpp</span>(3)</span></a> page has details
      of this interface. Other people's contributions can be found
      in the <code class="function">Contrib</code> directory at the
      primary FTP site, which is:</p>

      <p><a class="literalurl" href="ftp://ftp.csx.cam.ac.uk/pub/software/programming/pcre" target="_top" shape="rect">ftp://ftp.csx.cam.ac.uk/pub/software/programming/pcre</a></p>

      <p>Details of exactly which Perl regular expression features
      are and are not supported by PCRE are given in separate
      documents. See the <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcrepattern.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcrepattern</span>(3)</span></a> and
      <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcrecompat.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcrecompat</span>(3)</span></a> pages. There
      is a syntax summary in the <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcresyntax.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcresyntax</span>(3)</span></a> page.</p>

      <p>Some features of PCRE can be included, excluded, or
      changed when the library is built. The <span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcre_config()</span>(3)</span> function makes
      it possible for a client to discover which features are
      available. The features themselves are described in the
      <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcrebuild.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcrebuild</span>(3)</span></a> page.
      Documentation about building PCRE for various operating
      systems can be found in the <code class="constant">README</code> and <em class="replaceable"><code>NON-UNIX-USE</code></em> files in the
      source distribution.</p>

      <p>The library contains a number of undocumented internal
      functions and data tables that are used by more than one of
      the exported external functions, but which are not intended
      for use by external callers. Their names all begin with
      "_pcre_", which hopefully will not provoke any name clashes.
      In some environments, it is possible to control which
      external symbols are exported when a shared library is built,
      and in these cases the undocumented symbols are not
      exported.</p>

      <h2>USER DOCUMENTATION</h2>

      <p>The user documentation for PCRE comprises a number of
      different sections. In the "man" format, each of these is a
      separate "man page". In the HTML format, each is a separate
      page, linked from the index page. In the plain text format,
      all the sections, except the <code class="function">pcredemo</code> section, are concatenated, for
      ease of searching. The sections are as follows:</p>

    <div class="refsect1" title="LIMITATIONS">
      <a id="pcre-3_sect3" name="pcre-3_sect3" shape="rect"> </a>

      <h2>LIMITATIONS</h2>

      <p>There are some size limitations in PCRE but it is hoped
      that they will never in practice be relevant.</p>

      <p>The maximum length of a compiled pattern is 65539 (sic)
      bytes if PCRE is compiled with the default internal linkage
      size of 2. If you want to process regular expressions that
      are truly enormous, you can compile PCRE with an internal
      linkage size of 3 or 4 (see the <code class="constant">README</code> file in the source distribution and
      the <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcrebuild.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcrebuild</span>(3)</span></a> documentation
      for details). In these cases the limit is substantially
      larger. However, the speed of execution is slower.</p>

      <p>All values in repeating quantifiers must be less than
      65536.</p>

      <p>There is no limit to the number of parenthesized
      subpatterns, but there can be no more than 65535 capturing
      subpatterns.</p>

      <p>The maximum length of name for a named subpattern is 32
      characters, and the maximum number of named subpatterns is
      10000.</p>

      <p>The maximum length of a subject string is the largest
      positive number that an integer variable can hold. However,
      when using the traditional matching function, PCRE uses
      recursion to handle subpatterns and indefinite repetition.
      This means that the available stack space may limit the size
      of a subject string that can be processed by certain
      patterns. For a discussion of stack issues, see the <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcrestack.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcrestack</span>(3)</span></a>

    <div class="refsect1" title="UTF-8 AND UNICODE PROPERTY SUPPORT">
      <a id="pcre-3_sect4" name="pcre-3_sect4" shape="rect"> </a>

      <h2>UTF-8 AND UNICODE PROPERTY SUPPORT</h2>

      <p>From release 3.3, PCRE has had some support for character
      strings encoded in the UTF-8 format. For release 4.0 this was
      greatly extended to cover most common requirements, and in
      release 5.0 additional support for Unicode general category
      properties was added.</p>

      <p>In order process UTF-8 strings, you must build PCRE to
      include UTF-8 support in the code, and, in addition, you must
      call <span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcre_compile()</span>(3)</span> with the
      PCRE_UTF8 option flag, or the pattern must start with the
      sequence (*UTF8). When either of these is the case, both the
      pattern and any subject strings that are matched against it
      are treated as UTF-8 strings instead of strings of 1-byte
      characters.</p>

      <p>If you compile PCRE with UTF-8 support, but do not use it
      at run time, the library will be a bit bigger, but the
      additional run time overhead is limited to testing the
      PCRE_UTF8 flag occasionally, so should not be very big.</p>

      <p>If PCRE is built with Unicode character property support
      (which implies UTF-8 support), the escape sequences \p{..},
      \P{..}, and \X are supported. The available properties that
      can be tested are limited to the general category properties
      such as Lu for an upper case letter or Nd for a decimal
      number, the Unicode script names such as Arabic or Han, and
      the derived properties Any and L&amp;. A full list is given
      in the <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcrepattern.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcrepattern</span>(3)</span></a>
      documentation. Only the short names for properties are
      supported. For example, \p{L} matches a letter. Its Perl
      synonym, \p{Letter}, is not supported. Furthermore, in Perl,
      many properties may optionally be prefixed by "Is", for
      compatibility with Perl 5.6. PCRE does not support this.</p>

      <div class="refsect2" title="Validity of UTF-8 strings">
        <a id="pcre-3_sect5" name="pcre-3_sect5" shape="rect"> </a>

        <h3>Validity of UTF-8 strings</h3>

        <p>When you set the PCRE_UTF8 flag, the strings passed as
        patterns and subjects are (by default) checked for validity
        on entry to the relevant functions. From release 7.3 of
        PCRE, the check is according the rules of RFC 3629, which
        are themselves derived from the Unicode specification.
        Earlier releases of PCRE followed the rules of RFC 2279,
        which allows the full range of 31-bit values (0 to
        0x7FFFFFFF). The current check allows only values in the
        range U+0 to U+10FFFF, excluding U+D800 to U+DFFF.</p>

        <p>The excluded code points are the "Low Surrogate Area" of
        Unicode, of which the Unicode Standard says this: "The Low
        Surrogate Area does not contain any character assignments,
        consequently no character code charts or namelists are
        provided for this area. Surrogates are reserved for use
        with UTF-16 and then must be used in pairs." The code
        points that are encoded by UTF-16 pairs are available as
        independent code points in the UTF-8 encoding. (In other
        words, the whole surrogate thing is a fudge for UTF-16
        which unfortunately messes up UTF-8.)</p>

        <p>If an invalid UTF-8 string is passed to PCRE, an error
        return (PCRE_ERROR_BADUTF8) is given. In some situations,
        you may already know that your strings are valid, and
        therefore want to skip these checks in order to improve
        performance. If you set the PCRE_NO_UTF8_CHECK flag at
        compile time or at run time, PCRE assumes that the pattern
        or subject it is given (respectively) contains only valid
        UTF-8 codes. In this case, it does not diagnose an invalid
        UTF-8 string.</p>

        <p>If you pass an invalid UTF-8 string when
        PCRE_NO_UTF8_CHECK is set, what happens depends on why the
        string is invalid. If the string conforms to the "old"
        definition of UTF-8 (RFC 2279), it is processed as a string
        of characters in the range 0 to 0x7FFFFFFF. In other words,
        apart from the initial validity test, PCRE (when in UTF-8
        mode) handles strings according to the more liberal rules
        of RFC 2279. However, if the string does not even conform
        to RFC 2279, the result is undefined. Your program may
        crash.</p>

        <p>If you want to process strings of values in the full
        range 0 to 0x7FFFFFFF, encoded in a UTF-8-like manner as
        per the old RFC, you can set PCRE_NO_UTF8_CHECK to bypass
        the more restrictive test. However, in this situation, you
        will have to apply your own validity check.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="refsect2" title="General comments about UTF-8 mode">
        <a id="pcre-3_sect6" name="pcre-3_sect6" shape="rect"> </a>

        <h3>General comments about UTF-8 mode</h3>

        <p>1. An unbraced hexadecimal escape sequence (such as
        \xb3) matches a two-byte UTF-8 character if the value is
        greater than 127.</p>

        <p>2. Octal numbers up to \777 are recognized, and match
        two-byte UTF-8 characters for values greater than \177.</p>

        <p>3. Repeat quantifiers apply to complete UTF-8
        characters, not to individual bytes, for example:
        \x{100}{3}.</p>

        <p>4. The dot metacharacter matches one UTF-8 character
        instead of a single byte.</p>

        <p>5. The escape sequence \C can be used to match a single
        byte in UTF-8 mode, but its use can lead to some strange
        effects. This facility is not available in the alternative
        matching function, <code class="function">pcre_dfa_exec</code>().</p>

        <p>6. The character escapes \b, \B, \d, \D, \s, \S, \w, and
        \W correctly test characters of any code value, but, by
        default, the characters that PCRE recognizes as digits,
        spaces, or word characters remain the same set as before,
        all with values less than 256. This remains true even when
        PCRE is built to include Unicode property support, because
        to do otherwise would slow down PCRE in many common cases.
        Note in particular that this applies to \b and \B, because
        they are defined in terms of \w and \W. If you really want
        to test for a wider sense of, say, "digit", you can use
        explicit Unicode property tests such as \p{Nd}.
        Alternatively, if you set the PCRE_UCP option, the way that
        the character escapes work is changed so that Unicode
        properties are used to determine which characters match.
        There are more details in the section on generic character
        types in the <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcrepattern.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcrepattern</span>(3)</span></a>
        documentation.</p>

        <p>7. Similarly, characters that match the POSIX named
        character classes are all low-valued characters, unless the
        PCRE_UCP option is set.</p>

        <p>8. However, the horizontal and vertical whitespace
        matching escapes (\h, \H, \v, and \V) do match all the
        appropriate Unicode characters, whether or not PCRE_UCP is
        set.</p>

        <p>9. Case-insensitive matching applies only to characters
        whose values are less than 128, unless PCRE is built with
        Unicode property support. Even when Unicode property
        support is available, PCRE still uses its own character
        tables when checking the case of low-valued characters, so
        as not to degrade performance. The Unicode property
        information is used only for characters with higher values.
        Furthermore, PCRE supports case-insensitive matching only
        when there is a one-to-one mapping between a letter's
        cases. There are a small number of many-to-one mappings in
        Unicode; these are not supported by PCRE.</p>
