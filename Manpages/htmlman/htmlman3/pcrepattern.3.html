      <h2>PCRE REGULAR EXPRESSION DETAILS</h2>

      <p>The syntax and semantics of the regular expressions that
      are supported by PCRE are described in detail below. There is
      a quick-reference syntax summary in the <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcresyntax.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcresyntax</span>(3)</span></a> page. PCRE
      tries to match Perl syntax and semantics as closely as it
      can. PCRE also supports some alternative regular expression
      syntax (which does not conflict with the Perl syntax) in
      order to provide some compatibility with regular expressions
      in Python, .NET, and Oniguruma.</p>

      <p>Perl's regular expressions are described in its own
      documentation, and regular expressions in general are covered
      in a number of books, some of which have copious examples.
      Jeffrey Friedl's "Mastering Regular Expressions", published
      by O'Reilly, covers regular expressions in great detail. This
      description of PCRE's regular expressions is intended as
      reference material.</p>

      <p>The original operation of PCRE was on strings of one-byte
      characters. However, there is now also support for UTF-8
      character strings. To use this, PCRE must be built to include
      UTF-8 support, and you must call <code class="function">pcre_compile</code>() or <code class="function">pcre_compile2</code>() with the PCRE_UTF8 option.
      There is also a special sequence that can be given at the
      start of a pattern:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(*UTF8)
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>Starting a pattern with this sequence is equivalent to
      setting the PCRE_UTF8 option. This feature is not
      Perl-compatible. How setting UTF-8 mode affects pattern
      matching is mentioned in several places below. There is also
      a summary of UTF-8 features in the section on UTF-8 support
      in the main <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcre.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcre</span>(3)</span></a> page.</p>

      <p>Another special sequence that may appear at the start of a
      pattern or in combination with (*UTF8) is:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(*UCP)
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>This has the same effect as setting the PCRE_UCP option:
      it causes sequences such as \d and \w to use Unicode
      properties to determine character types, instead of
      recognizing only characters with codes less than 128 via a
      lookup table.</p>

      <p>If a pattern starts with (*NO_START_OPT), it has the same
      effect as setting the PCRE_NO_START_OPTIMIZE option either at
      compile or matching time. There are also some more of these
      special sequences that are concerned with the handling of
      newlines; they are described below.</p>

      <p>The remainder of this document discusses the patterns that
      are supported by PCRE when its main matching function,
      <code class="function">pcre_exec</code>(), is used. From
      release 6.0, PCRE offers a second matching function,
      <code class="function">pcre_dfa_exec</code>(), which matches
      using a different algorithm that is not Perl-compatible. Some
      of the features discussed below are not available when
      <code class="function">pcre_dfa_exec</code>() is used. The
      advantages and disadvantages of the alternative function, and
      how it differs from the normal function, are discussed in the
      <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcrematching.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcrematching</span>(3)</span></a> page.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="refsect1" title="NEWLINE CONVENTIONS">
      <a id="pcrepattern-3_sect2" name="pcrepattern-3_sect2" shape="rect"> </a>

      <h2>NEWLINE CONVENTIONS</h2>

      <p>PCRE supports five different conventions for indicating
      line breaks in strings: a single CR (carriage return)
      character, a single LF (linefeed) character, the
      two-character sequence CRLF, any of the three preceding, or
      any Unicode newline sequence. The <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcreapi.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcreapi</span>(3)</span></a> page has further
      discussion about newlines, and shows how to set the newline
      convention in the <em class="parameter"><code>options</code></em> arguments for the
      compiling and matching functions.</p>

      <p>It is also possible to specify a newline convention by
      starting a pattern string with one of the following five
      sequences:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 (*CR)        carriage return
 (*LF)        linefeed
 (*CRLF)      carriage return, followed by linefeed
 (*ANYCRLF)   any of the three above
 (*ANY)       all Unicode newline sequences
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>These override the default and the options given to
      <code class="function">pcre_compile</code>() or <code class="function">pcre_compile2</code>(). For example, on a Unix
      system where LF is the default newline sequence, the
      pattern</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(*CR)a.b
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>changes the convention to CR. That pattern matches "a\nb"
      because LF is no longer a newline. Note that these special
      settings, which are not Perl-compatible, are recognized only
      at the very start of a pattern, and that they must be in
      upper case. If more than one of them is present, the last one
      is used.</p>

      <p>The newline convention affects the interpretation of the
      dot metacharacter when PCRE_DOTALL is not set, and also the
      behaviour of \N. However, it does not affect what the \R
      escape sequence matches. By default, this is any Unicode
      newline sequence, for Perl compatibility. However, this can
      be changed; see the description of \R in the section entitled
      "Newline sequences" below. A change of \R setting can be
      combined with a change of newline convention.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="refsect1" title="CHARACTERS AND METACHARACTERS">
      <a id="pcrepattern-3_sect3" name="pcrepattern-3_sect3" shape="rect"> </a>

      <h2>CHARACTERS AND METACHARACTERS</h2>

      <p>A regular expression is a pattern that is matched against
      a subject string from left to right. Most characters stand
      for themselves in a pattern, and match the corresponding
      characters in the subject. As a trivial example, the
      pattern</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
The quick brown fox
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>matches a portion of a subject string that is identical to
      itself. When caseless matching is specified (the
      PCRE_CASELESS option), letters are matched independently of
      case. In UTF-8 mode, PCRE always understands the concept of
      case for characters whose values are less than 128, so
      caseless matching is always possible. For characters with
      higher values, the concept of case is supported if PCRE is
      compiled with Unicode property support, but not otherwise. If
      you want to use caseless matching for characters 128 and
      above, you must ensure that PCRE is compiled with Unicode
      property support as well as with UTF-8 support.</p>

      <p>The power of regular expressions comes from the ability to
      include alternatives and repetitions in the pattern. These
      are encoded in the pattern by the use of <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">metacharacters</span>”</span>, which do not
      stand for themselves but instead are interpreted in some
      special way.</p>

      <p>There are two different sets of metacharacters: those that
      are recognized anywhere in the pattern except within square
      brackets, and those that are recognized within square
      brackets. Outside square brackets, the metacharacters are as
      follows:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 \      general escape character with several uses
 ^      assert start of string (or line, in multiline mode)
 $      assert end of string (or line, in multiline mode)
 .      match any character except newline (by default)
 [      start character class definition
 |      start of alternative branch
 (      start subpattern
 )      end subpattern
 ?      extends the meaning of (
        also 0 or 1 quantifier
        also quantifier minimizer
 *      0 or more quantifier
 +      1 or more quantifier
        also "possessive quantifier"
 {      start min/max quantifier
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>Part of a pattern that is in square brackets is called a
      "character class". In a character class the only
      metacharacters are:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 \      general escape character
 ^      negate the class, but only if the first character
 -      indicates character range
 [      POSIX character class (only if followed by POSIX
          syntax)
 ]      terminates the character class
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>The following sections describe the use of each of the
      metacharacters.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="refsect1" title="BACKSLASH">
      <a id="pcrepattern-3_sect4" name="pcrepattern-3_sect4" shape="rect"> </a>

      <h2>BACKSLASH</h2>

      <p>The backslash character has several uses. Firstly, if it
      is followed by a character that is not a number or a letter,
      it takes away any special meaning that character may have.
      This use of backslash as an escape character applies both
      inside and outside character classes.</p>

      <p>For example, if you want to match a * character, you write
      \* in the pattern. This escaping action applies whether or
      not the following character would otherwise be interpreted as
      a metacharacter, so it is always safe to precede a
      non-alphanumeric with backslash to specify that it stands for
      itself. In particular, if you want to match a backslash, you
      write \\.</p>

      <p>In UTF-8 mode, only ASCII numbers and letters have any
      special meaning after a backslash. All other characters (in
      particular, those whose codepoints are greater than 127) are
      treated as literals.</p>

      <p>If a pattern is compiled with the PCRE_EXTENDED option,
      whitespace in the pattern (other than in a character class)
      and characters between a # outside a character class and the
      next newline are ignored. An escaping backslash can be used
      to include a whitespace or # character as part of the
      pattern.</p>

      <p>If you want to remove the special meaning from a sequence
      of characters, you can do so by putting them between \Q and
      \E. This is different from Perl in that $ and @ are handled
      as literals in \Q...\E sequences in PCRE, whereas in Perl, $
      and @ cause variable interpolation. Note the following
      examples:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
Pattern            PCRE matches   Perl matches
</pre>
      </div>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 \Qabc$xyz\E        abc$xyz        abc followed by the
                                     contents of $xyz
 \Qabc\$xyz\E       abc\$xyz       abc\$xyz
 \Qabc\E\$\Qxyz\E   abc$xyz        abc$xyz
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>The \Q...\E sequence is recognized both inside and outside
      character classes. An isolated \E that is not preceded by \Q
      is ignored.</p>

      <div class="refsect2" title="Non-printing characters">
        <a id="pcrepattern-3_sect5" name="pcrepattern-3_sect5" shape="rect"> </a>

        <h3>Non-printing characters</h3>

        <p>A second use of backslash provides a way of encoding
        non-printing characters in patterns in a visible manner.
        There is no restriction on the appearance of non-printing
        characters, apart from the binary zero that terminates a
        pattern, but when a pattern is being prepared by text
        editing, it is often easier to use one of the following
        escape sequences than the binary character it
        represents:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 \a        alarm, that is, the BEL character (hex 07)
 \cx       "control-x", where x is any ASCII character
 \e        escape (hex 1B)
 \f        formfeed (hex 0C)
 \n        linefeed (hex 0A)
 \r        carriage return (hex 0D)
 \t        tab (hex 09)
 \ddd      character with octal code ddd, or back reference
 \xhh      character with hex code hh
 \x{hhh..} character with hex code hhh..
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>The precise effect of \cx is as follows: if x is a lower
        case letter, it is converted to upper case. Then bit 6 of
        the character (hex 40) is inverted. Thus \cz becomes hex 1A
        (z is 7A), but \c{ becomes hex 3B ({ is 7B), while \c;
        becomes hex 7B (; is 3B). If the byte following \c has a
        value greater than 127, a compile-time error occurs. This
        locks out non-ASCII characters in both byte mode and UTF-8
        mode. (When PCRE is compiled in EBCDIC mode, all byte
        values are valid. A lower case letter is converted to upper
        case, and then the 0xc0 bits are flipped.)</p>

        <p>After \x, from zero to two hexadecimal digits are read
        (letters can be in upper or lower case). Any number of
        hexadecimal digits may appear between \x{ and }, but the
        value of the character code must be less than 256 in
        non-UTF-8 mode, and less than 2**31 in UTF-8 mode. That is,
        the maximum value in hexadecimal is 7FFFFFFF. Note that
        this is bigger than the largest Unicode code point, which
        is 10FFFF.</p>

        <p>If characters other than hexadecimal digits appear
        between \x{ and }, or if there is no terminating }, this
        form of escape is not recognized. Instead, the initial \x
        will be interpreted as a basic hexadecimal escape, with no
        following digits, giving a character whose value is
        zero.</p>

        <p>Characters whose value is less than 256 can be defined
        by either of the two syntaxes for \x. There is no
        difference in the way they are handled. For example, \xdc
        is exactly the same as \x{dc}.</p>

        <p>After \0 up to two further octal digits are read. If
        there are fewer than two digits, just those that are
        present are used. Thus the sequence \0\x\07 specifies two
        binary zeros followed by a BEL character (code value 7).
        Make sure you supply two digits after the initial zero if
        the pattern character that follows is itself an octal
        digit.</p>

        <p>The handling of a backslash followed by a digit other
        than 0 is complicated. Outside a character class, PCRE
        reads it and any following digits as a decimal number. If
        the number is less than 10, or if there have been at least
        that many previous capturing left parentheses in the
        expression, the entire sequence is taken as a <span class="emphasis"><em>back reference</em></span>. A description of
        how this works is given later, following the discussion of
        parenthesized subpatterns.</p>

        <p>Inside a character class, or if the decimal number is
        greater than 9 and there have not been that many capturing
        subpatterns, PCRE re-reads up to three octal digits
        following the backslash, and uses them to generate a data
        character. Any subsequent digits stand for themselves. In
        non-UTF-8 mode, the value of a character specified in octal
        must be less than \400. In UTF-8 mode, values up to \777
        are permitted. For example:</p>

        <p>\040 is another way of writing a space</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 \40    is the same, provided there are fewer than 40
           previous capturing subpatterns
 \7     is always a back reference
 \11    might be a back reference, or another way of
           writing a tab
 \011   is always a tab
 \0113  is a tab followed by the character "3"
 \113   might be a back reference, otherwise the
           character with octal code 113
 \377   might be a back reference, otherwise
           the byte consisting entirely of 1 bits
 \81    is either a back reference, or a binary zero
           followed by the two characters "8" and "1"
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>Note that octal values of 100 or greater must not be
        introduced by a leading zero, because no more than three
        octal digits are ever read.</p>

        <p>All the sequences that define a single character value
        can be used both inside and outside character classes. In
        addition, inside a character class, the sequence \b is
        interpreted as the backspace character (hex 08). The
        sequences \B, \N, \R, and \X are not special inside a
        character class. Like any other unrecognized escape
        sequences, they are treated as the literal characters "B",
        "N", "R", and "X" by default, but cause an error if the
        PCRE_EXTRA option is set. Outside a character class, these
        sequences have different meanings.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="refsect2" title="Absolute and relative back references">
        <a id="pcrepattern-3_sect6" name="pcrepattern-3_sect6" shape="rect"> </a>

        <h3>Absolute and relative back references</h3>

        <p>The sequence \g followed by an unsigned or a negative
        number, optionally enclosed in braces, is an absolute or
        relative back reference. A named back reference can be
        coded as \g{name}. Back references are discussed later,
        following the discussion of parenthesized subpatterns.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="refsect2" title="Absolute and relative subroutine calls">
        <a id="pcrepattern-3_sect7" name="pcrepattern-3_sect7" shape="rect"> </a>

        <h3>Absolute and relative subroutine calls</h3>

        <p>For compatibility with Oniguruma, the non-Perl syntax \g
        followed by a name or a number enclosed either in angle
        brackets or single quotes, is an alternative syntax for
        referencing a subpattern as a "subroutine". Details are
        discussed later. Note that \g{...} (Perl syntax) and
        \g&lt;...&gt; (Oniguruma syntax) are <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> synonymous. The former is a
        back reference; the latter is a subroutine call.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="refsect2" title="Generic character types">
        <a id="pcrepattern-3_sect8" name="pcrepattern-3_sect8" shape="rect"> </a>

        <h3>Generic character types</h3>

        <p>Another use of backslash is for specifying generic
        character types:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 \d     any decimal digit
 \D     any character that is not a decimal digit
 \h     any horizontal whitespace character
 \H     any character that is not a horizontal whitespace character
 \s     any whitespace character
 \S     any character that is not a whitespace character
 \v     any vertical whitespace character
 \V     any character that is not a vertical whitespace character
 \w     any "word" character
 \W     any "non-word" character
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>There is also the single sequence \N, which matches a
        non-newline character. This is the same as the "."
        metacharacter when PCRE_DOTALL is not set.</p>

        <p>Each pair of lower and upper case escape sequences
        partitions the complete set of characters into two disjoint
        sets. Any given character matches one, and only one, of
        each pair. The sequences can appear both inside and outside
        character classes. They each match one character of the
        appropriate type. If the current matching point is at the
        end of the subject string, all of them fail, because there
        is no character to match.</p>

        <p>For compatibility with Perl, \s does not match the VT
        character (code 11). This makes it different from the the
        POSIX "space" class. The \s characters are HT (9), LF (10),
        FF (12), CR (13), and space (32). If "use locale;" is
        included in a Perl script, \s may match the VT character.
        In PCRE, it never does.</p>

        <p>A "word" character is an underscore or any character
        that is a letter or digit. By default, the definition of
        letters and digits is controlled by PCRE's low-valued
        character tables, and may vary if locale-specific matching
        is taking place (see "Locale support" in the <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcreapi.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcreapi</span>(3)</span></a> page). For
        example, in a French locale such as "fr_FR" in Unix-like
        systems, or "french" in Windows, some character codes
        greater than 128 are used for accented letters, and these
        are then matched by \w. The use of locales with Unicode is
        discouraged.</p>

        <p>By default, in UTF-8 mode, characters with values
        greater than 128 never match \d, \s, or \w, and always
        match \D, \S, and \W. These sequences retain their original
        meanings from before UTF-8 support was available, mainly
        for efficiency reasons. However, if PCRE is compiled with
        Unicode property support, and the PCRE_UCP option is set,
        the behaviour is changed so that Unicode properties are
        used to determine character types, as follows:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 \d  any character that \p{Nd} matches (decimal digit)
 \s  any character that \p{Z} matches, plus HT, LF, FF, CR
 \w  any character that \p{L} or \p{N} matches, plus underscore
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>The upper case escapes match the inverse sets of
        characters. Note that \d matches only decimal digits,
        whereas \w matches any Unicode digit, as well as any
        Unicode letter, and underscore. Note also that PCRE_UCP
        affects \b, and \B because they are defined in terms of \w
        and \W. Matching these sequences is noticeably slower when
        PCRE_UCP is set.</p>

        <p>The sequences \h, \H, \v, and \V are features that were
        added to Perl at release 5.10. In contrast to the other
        sequences, which match only ASCII characters by default,
        these always match certain high-valued codepoints in UTF-8
        mode, whether or not PCRE_UCP is set. The horizontal space
        characters are:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 U+0009     Horizontal tab
 U+0020     Space
 U+00A0     Non-break space
 U+1680     Ogham space mark
 U+180E     Mongolian vowel separator
 U+2000     En quad
 U+2001     Em quad
 U+2002     En space
 U+2003     Em space
 U+2004     Three-per-em space
 U+2005     Four-per-em space

</pre>
        </div>

        <p>The vertical space characters are:</p>

          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 U+000A     Linefeed
 U+000B     Vertical tab

      <div class="refsect2" title="Newline sequences">
        <a id="pcrepattern-3_sect9" name="pcrepattern-3_sect9" shape="rect"> </a>

        <h3>Newline sequences</h3>

        <p>Outside a character class, by default, the escape
        sequence \R matches any Unicode newline sequence. In
        non-UTF-8 mode \R is equivalent to the following:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(?&gt;\r\n|\n|\x0b|\f|\r|\x85)
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>This is an example of an "atomic group", details of
        which are given below. This particular group matches either
        the two-character sequence CR followed by LF, or one of the
        single characters LF (linefeed, U+000A), VT (vertical tab,
        U+000B), FF (formfeed, U+000C), CR (carriage return,
        U+000D), or NEL (next line, U+0085). The two-character
        sequence is treated as a single unit that cannot be
        split.</p>

        <p>In UTF-8 mode, two additional characters whose
        codepoints are greater than 255 are added: LS (line
        separator, U+2028) and PS (paragraph separator, U+2029).
        Unicode character property support is not needed for these
        characters to be recognized.</p>

        <p>It is possible to restrict \R to match only CR, LF, or
        CRLF (instead of the complete set of Unicode line endings)
        by setting the option PCRE_BSR_ANYCRLF either at compile
        time or when the pattern is matched. (BSR is an abbrevation
        for "backslash R".) This can be made the default when PCRE
        is built; if this is the case, the other behaviour can be
        requested via the PCRE_BSR_UNICODE option. It is also
        possible to specify these settings by starting a pattern
        string with one of the following sequences:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 (*BSR_ANYCRLF)   CR, LF, or CRLF only
 (*BSR_UNICODE)   any Unicode newline sequence
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>These override the default and the options given to
        <code class="function">pcre_compile</code>() or
        <code class="function">pcre_compile2</code>(), but they can
        be overridden by options given to <code class="function">pcre_exec</code>() or <code class="function">pcre_dfa_exec</code>(). Note that these special
        settings, which are not Perl-compatible, are recognized
        only at the very start of a pattern, and that they must be
        in upper case. If more than one of them is present, the
        last one is used. They can be combined with a change of
        newline convention; for example, a pattern can start
        with:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(*ANY)(*BSR_ANYCRLF)
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>They can also be combined with the (*UTF8) or (*UCP)
        special sequences. Inside a character class, \R is treated
        as an unrecognized escape sequence, and so matches the
        letter "R" by default, but causes an error if PCRE_EXTRA is
        set.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="refsect2" title="Unicode character properties">
        <a id="pcrepattern-3_sect10" name="pcrepattern-3_sect10" shape="rect"> </a>

        <h3>Unicode character properties</h3>

        <p>When PCRE is built with Unicode character property
        support, three additional escape sequences that match
        characters with specific properties are available. When not
        in UTF-8 mode, these sequences are of course limited to
        testing characters whose codepoints are less than 256, but
        they do work in this mode. The extra escape sequences
        are:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 \p{<em class="replaceable"><code>xx</code></em>}   a character with the <em class="replaceable"><code>xx</code></em> property
 \P{<em class="replaceable"><code>xx</code></em>}   a character without the <em class="replaceable"><code>xx</code></em> property
 \X       an extended Unicode sequence
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>The property names represented by <em class="replaceable"><code>xx</code></em> above are limited to the
        Unicode script names, the general category properties,
        "Any", which matches any character (including newline), and
        some special PCRE properties (described in the next
        section). Other Perl properties such as "InMusicalSymbols"
        are not currently supported by PCRE. Note that \P{Any} does
        not match any characters, so always causes a match
        failure.</p>

        <p>Sets of Unicode characters are defined as belonging to
        certain scripts. A character from one of these sets can be
        matched using a script name. For example:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 \p{Greek}
 \P{Han}
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>Those that are not part of an identified script are
        lumped together as "Common". The current list of scripts
        is:</p>

        <p>Arabic, Armenian, Avestan, Balinese, Bamum, Bengali,
        Bopomofo, Braille, Buginese, Buhid, Canadian_Aboriginal,
        Carian, Cham, Cherokee, Common, Coptic, Cuneiform, Cypriot,
        Cyrillic, Deseret, Devanagari, Egyptian_Hieroglyphs,
        Ethiopic, Georgian, Glagolitic, Gothic, Greek, Gujarati,
        Gurmukhi, Han, Hangul, Hanunoo, Hebrew, Hiragana,
        Imperial_Aramaic, Inherited, Inscriptional_Pahlavi,
        Inscriptional_Parthian, Javanese, Kaithi, Kannada,
        Katakana, Kayah_Li, Kharoshthi, Khmer, Lao, Latin, Lepcha,
        Limbu, Linear_B, Lisu, Lycian, Lydian, Malayalam,
        Meetei_Mayek, Mongolian, Myanmar, New_Tai_Lue, Nko, Ogham,
        Old_Italic, Old_Persian, Old_South_Arabian, Old_Turkic,
        Ol_Chiki, Oriya, Osmanya, Phags_Pa, Phoenician, Rejang,
        Runic, Samaritan, Saurashtra, Shavian, Sinhala, Sundanese,
        Syloti_Nagri, Syriac, Tagalog, Tagbanwa, Tai_Le, Tai_Tham,
        Tai_Viet, Tamil, Telugu, Thaana, Thai, Tibetan, Tifinagh,
        Ugaritic, Vai, Yi.</p>

        <p>Each character has exactly one Unicode general category
        property, specified by a two-letter abbreviation. For
        compatibility with Perl, negation can be specified by
        including a circumflex between the opening brace and the
        property name. For example, \p{^Lu} is the same as
        \P{Lu}.</p>

        <p>If only one letter is specified with \p or \P, it
        includes all the general category properties that start
        with that letter. In this case, in the absence of negation,
        the curly brackets in the escape sequence are optional;
        these two examples have the same effect:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 \p{L}
 \pL
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>The following general category property codes are
        supported:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">

        <p>The special property L&amp; is also supported: it
        matches a character that has the Lu, Ll, or Lt property, in
        other words, a letter that is not classified as a modifier
        or "other".</p>

        <p>The Cs (Surrogate) property applies only to characters
        in the range U+D800 to U+DFFF. Such characters are not
        valid in UTF-8 strings (see RFC 3629) and so cannot be
        tested by PCRE, unless UTF-8 validity checking has been
        turned off (see the discussion of PCRE_NO_UTF8_CHECK in the
        <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcreapi.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcreapi</span>(3)</span></a> page). Perl
        does not support the Cs property.</p>

        <p>The long synonyms for property names that Perl supports
        (such as \p{Letter}) are not supported by PCRE, nor is it
        permitted to prefix any of these properties with "Is".</p>

        <p>No character that is in the Unicode table has the Cn
        (unassigned) property. Instead, this property is assumed
        for any code point that is not in the Unicode table.</p>

        <p>Specifying caseless matching does not affect these
        escape sequences. For example, \p{Lu} always matches only
        upper case letters.</p>

        <p>The \X escape matches any number of Unicode characters
        that form an extended Unicode sequence. \X is equivalent
        to</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(?&gt;\PM\pM*)
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>That is, it matches a character without the "mark"
        property, followed by zero or more characters with the
        "mark" property, and treats the sequence as an atomic group
        (see below). Characters with the "mark" property are
        typically accents that affect the preceding character. None
        of them have codepoints less than 256, so in non-UTF-8 mode
        \X matches any one character.</p>

        <p>Matching characters by Unicode property is not fast,
        because PCRE has to search a structure that contains data
        for over fifteen thousand characters. That is why the
        traditional escape sequences such as \d and \w do not use
        Unicode properties in PCRE by default, though you can make
        them do so by setting the PCRE_UCP option for <code class="function">pcre_compile</code>() or by starting the pattern
        with (*UCP).</p>
      </div>

      <div class="refsect2" title="PCRE's additional properties">
        <a id="pcrepattern-3_sect11" name="pcrepattern-3_sect11" shape="rect"> </a>

        <h3>PCRE's additional properties</h3>

        <p>As well as the standard Unicode properties described in
        the previous section, PCRE supports four more that make it
        possible to convert traditional escape sequences such as \w
        and \s and POSIX character classes to use Unicode
        properties. PCRE uses these non-standard, non-Perl
        properties internally when PCRE_UCP is set. They are:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 Xan   Any alphanumeric character
 Xps   Any POSIX space character
 Xsp   Any Perl space character
 Xwd   Any Perl "word" character
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>Xan matches characters that have either the L (letter)
        or the N (number) property. Xps matches the characters tab,
        linefeed, vertical tab, formfeed, or carriage return, and
        any other character that has the Z (separator) property.
        Xsp is the same as Xps, except that vertical tab is
        excluded. Xwd matches the same characters as Xan, plus
        underscore.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="refsect2" title="Resetting the match start">
        <a id="pcrepattern-3_sect12" name="pcrepattern-3_sect12" shape="rect"> </a>

        <h3>Resetting the match start</h3>

        <p>The escape sequence \K causes any previously matched
        characters not to be included in the final matched
        sequence. For example, the pattern:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
foo\Kbar
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>matches "foobar", but reports that it has matched "bar".
        This feature is similar to a lookbehind assertion
        (described below). However, in this case, the part of the
        subject before the real match does not have to be of fixed
        length, as lookbehind assertions do. The use of \K does not
        interfere with the setting of captured substrings. For
        example, when the pattern</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(foo)\Kbar
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>matches "foobar", the first substring is still set to
        "foo".</p>

        <p>Perl documents that the use of \K within assertions is
        "not well defined". In PCRE, \K is acted upon when it
        occurs inside positive assertions, but is ignored in
        negative assertions.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="refsect2" title="Simple assertions">
        <a id="pcrepattern-3_sect13" name="pcrepattern-3_sect13" shape="rect"> </a>

        <h3>Simple assertions</h3>

        <p>The final use of backslash is for certain simple
        assertions. An assertion specifies a condition that has to
        be met at a particular point in a match, without consuming
        any characters from the subject string. The use of
        subpatterns for more complicated assertions is described
        below. The backslashed assertions are:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 \b     matches at a word boundary
 \B     matches when not at a word boundary
 \A     matches at the start of the subject
 \Z     matches at the end of the subject
         also matches before a newline at the end of the subject
 \z     matches only at the end of the subject
 \G     matches at the first matching position in the subject
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>Inside a character class, \b has a different meaning; it
        matches the backspace character. If any other of these
        assertions appears in a character class, by default it
        matches the corresponding literal character (for example,
        \B matches the letter B). However, if the PCRE_EXTRA option
        is set, an "invalid escape sequence" error is generated
        instead.</p>

        <p>A word boundary is a position in the subject string
        where the current character and the previous character do
        not both match \w or \W (i.e. one matches \w and the other
        matches \W), or the start or end of the string if the first
        or last character matches \w, respectively. In UTF-8 mode,
        the meanings of \w and \W can be changed by setting the
        PCRE_UCP option. When this is done, it also affects \b and
        \B. Neither PCRE nor Perl has a separate "start of word" or
        "end of word" metasequence. However, whatever follows \b
        normally determines which it is. For example, the fragment
        \ba matches "a" at the start of a word.</p>

        <p>The \A, \Z, and \z assertions differ from the
        traditional circumflex and dollar (described in the next
        section) in that they only ever match at the very start and
        end of the subject string, whatever options are set. Thus,
        they are independent of multiline mode. These three
        assertions are not affected by the PCRE_NOTBOL or
        PCRE_NOTEOL options, which affect only the behaviour of the
        circumflex and dollar metacharacters. However, if the
        <em class="parameter"><code>startoffset</code></em>
        argument of <code class="function">pcre_exec</code>() is
        non-zero, indicating that matching is to start at a point
        other than the beginning of the subject, \A can never
        match. The difference between \Z and \z is that \Z matches
        before a newline at the end of the string as well as at the
        very end, whereas \z matches only at the end.</p>

        <p>The \G assertion is true only when the current matching
        position is at the start point of the match, as specified
        by the <em class="parameter"><code>startoffset</code></em>
        argument of <code class="function">pcre_exec</code>(). It
        differs from \A when the value of <em class="parameter"><code>startoffset</code></em> is non-zero. By
        calling <code class="function">pcre_exec</code>() multiple
        times with appropriate arguments, you can mimic Perl's /g
        option, and it is in this kind of implementation where \G
        can be useful.</p>

        <p>Note, however, that PCRE's interpretation of \G, as the
        start of the current match, is subtly different from
        Perl's, which defines it as the end of the previous match.
        In Perl, these can be different when the previously matched
        string was empty. Because PCRE does just one match at a
        time, it cannot reproduce this behaviour.</p>

        <p>If all the alternatives of a pattern begin with \G, the
        expression is anchored to the starting match position, and
        the "anchored" flag is set in the compiled regular
        expression.</p>

      <a id="pcrepattern-3_sect14" name="pcrepattern-3_sect14" shape="rect"> </a>

      <h2>CIRCUMFLEX AND DOLLAR</h2>

      <p>Outside a character class, in the default matching mode,
      the circumflex character is an assertion that is true only if
      the current matching point is at the start of the subject
      string. If the <em class="parameter"><code>startoffset</code></em> argument of
      <code class="function">pcre_exec</code>() is non-zero,
      circumflex can never match if the PCRE_MULTILINE option is
      unset. Inside a character class, circumflex has an entirely
      different meaning (see below).</p>

      <p>Circumflex need not be the first character of the pattern
      if a number of alternatives are involved, but it should be
      the first thing in each alternative in which it appears if
      the pattern is ever to match that branch. If all possible
      alternatives start with a circumflex, that is, if the pattern
      is constrained to match only at the start of the subject, it
      is said to be an "anchored" pattern. (There are also other
      constructs that can cause a pattern to be anchored.)</p>

      <p>A dollar character is an assertion that is true only if
      the current matching point is at the end of the subject
      string, or immediately before a newline at the end of the
      string (by default). Dollar need not be the last character of
      the pattern if a number of alternatives are involved, but it
      should be the last item in any branch in which it appears.
      Dollar has no special meaning in a character class.</p>

      <p>The meaning of dollar can be changed so that it matches
      only at the very end of the string, by setting the
      PCRE_DOLLAR_ENDONLY option at compile time. This does not
      affect the \Z assertion.</p>

      <p>The meanings of the circumflex and dollar characters are
      changed if the PCRE_MULTILINE option is set. When this is the
      case, a circumflex matches immediately after internal
      newlines as well as at the start of the subject string. It
      does not match after a newline that ends the string. A dollar
      matches before any newlines in the string, as well as at the
      very end, when PCRE_MULTILINE is set. When newline is
      specified as the two-character sequence CRLF, isolated CR and
      LF characters do not indicate newlines.</p>

      <p>For example, the pattern /^abc$/ matches the subject
      string "def\nabc" (where \n represents a newline) in
      multiline mode, but not otherwise. Consequently, patterns
      that are anchored in single line mode because all branches
      start with ^ are not anchored in multiline mode, and a match
      for circumflex is possible when the <em class="parameter"><code>startoffset</code></em> argument of
      <code class="function">pcre_exec</code>() is non-zero. The
      PCRE_DOLLAR_ENDONLY option is ignored if PCRE_MULTILINE is
      set.</p>

      <p>Note that the sequences \A, \Z, and \z can be used to
      match the start and end of the subject in both modes, and if
      all branches of a pattern start with \A it is always
      anchored, whether or not PCRE_MULTILINE is set.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="refsect1" title="FULL STOP (PERIOD, DOT) AND \N">
      <a id="pcrepattern-3_sect15" name="pcrepattern-3_sect15" shape="rect"> </a>

      <h2>FULL STOP (PERIOD, DOT) AND \N</h2>

      <p>Outside a character class, a dot in the pattern matches
      any one character in the subject string except (by default) a
      character that signifies the end of a line. In UTF-8 mode,
      the matched character may be more than one byte long.</p>

      <p>When a line ending is defined as a single character, dot
      never matches that character; when the two-character sequence
      CRLF is used, dot does not match CR if it is immediately
      followed by LF, but otherwise it matches all characters
      (including isolated CRs and LFs). When any Unicode line
      endings are being recognized, dot does not match CR or LF or
      any of the other line ending characters.</p>

      <p>The behaviour of dot with regard to newlines can be
      changed. If the PCRE_DOTALL option is set, a dot matches any
      one character, without exception. If the two-character
      sequence CRLF is present in the subject string, it takes two
      dots to match it.</p>

      <p>The handling of dot is entirely independent of the
      handling of circumflex and dollar, the only relationship
      being that they both involve newlines. Dot has no special
      meaning in a character class.</p>

      <p>The escape sequence \N behaves like a dot, except that it
      is not affected by the PCRE_DOTALL option. In other words, it
      matches any character except one that signifies the end of a
      line.</p>

    <div class="refsect1" title="MATCHING A SINGLE BYTE">
      <a id="pcrepattern-3_sect16" name="pcrepattern-3_sect16" shape="rect"> </a>

      <h2>MATCHING A SINGLE BYTE</h2>

      <p>Outside a character class, the escape sequence \C matches
      any one byte, both in and out of UTF-8 mode. Unlike a dot, it
      always matches any line-ending characters. The feature is
      provided in Perl in order to match individual bytes in UTF-8
      mode. Because it breaks up UTF-8 characters into individual
      bytes, the rest of the string may start with a malformed
      UTF-8 character. For this reason, the \C escape sequence is
      best avoided.</p>

      <p>PCRE does not allow \C to appear in lookbehind assertions
      (described below), because in UTF-8 mode this would make it
      impossible to calculate the length of the lookbehind.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="refsect1" title="SQUARE BRACKETS AND CHARACTER CLASSES">
      <a id="pcrepattern-3_sect17" name="pcrepattern-3_sect17" shape="rect"> </a>

      <h2>SQUARE BRACKETS AND CHARACTER CLASSES</h2>

      <p>An opening square bracket introduces a character class,
      terminated by a closing square bracket. A closing square
      bracket on its own is not special by default. However, if the
      PCRE_JAVASCRIPT_COMPAT option is set, a lone closing square
      bracket causes a compile-time error. If a closing square
      bracket is required as a member of the class, it should be
      the first data character in the class (after an initial
      circumflex, if present) or escaped with a backslash.</p>

      <p>A character class matches a single character in the
      subject. In UTF-8 mode, the character may be more than one
      byte long. A matched character must be in the set of
      characters defined by the class, unless the first character
      in the class definition is a circumflex, in which case the
      subject character must not be in the set defined by the
      class. If a circumflex is actually required as a member of
      the class, ensure it is not the first character, or escape it
      with a backslash.</p>

      <p>For example, the character class [aeiou] matches any lower
      case vowel, while [^aeiou] matches any character that is not
      a lower case vowel. Note that a circumflex is just a
      convenient notation for specifying the characters that are in
      the class by enumerating those that are not. A class that
      starts with a circumflex is not an assertion; it still
      consumes a character from the subject string, and therefore
      it fails if the current pointer is at the end of the
      string.</p>

      <p>In UTF-8 mode, characters with values greater than 255 can
      be included in a class as a literal string of bytes, or by
      using the \x{ escaping mechanism.</p>

      <p>When caseless matching is set, any letters in a class
      represent both their upper case and lower case versions, so
      for example, a caseless [aeiou] matches "A" as well as "a",
      and a caseless [^aeiou] does not match "A", whereas a caseful
      version would. In UTF-8 mode, PCRE always understands the
      concept of case for characters whose values are less than
      128, so caseless matching is always possible. For characters
      with higher values, the concept of case is supported if PCRE
      is compiled with Unicode property support, but not otherwise.
      If you want to use caseless matching in UTF8-mode for
      characters 128 and above, you must ensure that PCRE is
      compiled with Unicode property support as well as with UTF-8
      support.</p>

      <p>Characters that might indicate line breaks are never
      treated in any special way when matching character classes,
      whatever line-ending sequence is in use, and whatever setting
      of the PCRE_DOTALL and PCRE_MULTILINE options is used. A
      class such as [^a] always matches one of these
      characters.</p>

      <p>The minus (hyphen) character can be used to specify a
      range of characters in a character class. For example, [d-m]
      matches any letter between d and m, inclusive. If a minus
      character is required in a class, it must be escaped with a
      backslash or appear in a position where it cannot be
      interpreted as indicating a range, typically as the first or
      last character in the class.</p>

      <p>It is not possible to have the literal character "]" as
      the end character of a range. A pattern such as [W-]46] is
      interpreted as a class of two characters ("W" and "-")
      followed by a literal string "46]", so it would match "W46]"
      or "-46]". However, if the "]" is escaped with a backslash it
      is interpreted as the end of range, so [W-\]46] is
      interpreted as a class containing a range followed by two
      other characters. The octal or hexadecimal representation of
      "]" can also be used to end a range.</p>

      <p>Ranges operate in the collating sequence of character
      values. They can also be used for characters specified
      numerically, for example [\000-\037]. In UTF-8 mode, ranges
      can include characters whose values are greater than 255, for
      example [\x{100}-\x{2ff}].</p>

      <p>If a range that includes letters is used when caseless
      matching is set, it matches the letters in either case. For
      example, [W-c] is equivalent to [][\\^_`wxyzabc], matched
      caselessly, and in non-UTF-8 mode, if character tables for a
      French locale are in use, [\xc8-\xcb] matches accented E
      characters in both cases. In UTF-8 mode, PCRE supports the
      concept of case for characters with values greater than 128
      only when it is compiled with Unicode property support.</p>

      <p>The character escape sequences \d, \D, \h, \H, \p, \P, \s,
      \S, \v, \V, \w, and \W may appear in a character class, and
      add the characters that they match to the class. For example,
      [\dABCDEF] matches any hexadecimal digit. In UTF-8 mode, the
      PCRE_UCP option affects the meanings of \d, \s, \w and their
      upper case partners, just as it does when they appear outside
      a character class, as described in the section entitled
      "Generic character types" above. The escape sequence \b has a
      different meaning inside a character class; it matches the
      backspace character. The sequences \B, \N, \R, and \X are not
      special inside a character class. Like any other unrecognized
      escape sequences, they are treated as the literal characters
      "B", "N", "R", and "X" by default, but cause an error if the
      PCRE_EXTRA option is set.</p>

      <p>A circumflex can conveniently be used with the upper case
      character types to specify a more restricted set of
      characters than the matching lower case type. For example,
      the class [^\W_] matches any letter or digit, but not
      underscore, whereas [\w] includes underscore. A positive
      character class should be read as "something OR something OR
      ..." and a negative class as "NOT something AND NOT something
      AND NOT ...".</p>

      <p>The only metacharacters that are recognized in character
      classes are backslash, hyphen (only where it can be
      interpreted as specifying a range), circumflex (only at the
      start), opening square bracket (only when it can be
      interpreted as introducing a POSIX class name - see the next
      section), and the terminating closing square bracket.
      However, escaping other non-alphanumeric characters does no
      harm.</p>

      <a id="pcrepattern-3_sect18" name="pcrepattern-3_sect18" shape="rect"> </a>

      <h2>POSIX CHARACTER CLASSES</h2>

      <p>Perl supports the POSIX notation for character classes.
      This uses names enclosed by [: and :] within the enclosing
      square brackets. PCRE also supports this notation. For
      example,</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
[01[:alpha:]%]
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>matches "0", "1", any alphabetic character, or "%". The
      supported class names are:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 alnum    letters and digits
 alpha    letters
 ascii    character codes 0 - 127
 blank    space or tab only
 cntrl    control characters
 digit    decimal digits (same as \d)
 graph    printing characters, excluding space
 lower    lower case letters
 print    printing characters, including space
 punct    printing characters, excluding letters and digits and space
 space    white space (not quite the same as \s)
 upper    upper case letters
 word     "word" characters (same as \w)
 xdigit   hexadecimal digits
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>The "space" characters are HT (9), LF (10), VT (11), FF
      (12), CR (13), and space (32). Notice that this list includes
      the VT character (code 11). This makes "space" different to
      \s, which does not include VT (for Perl compatibility).</p>

      <p>The name "word" is a Perl extension, and "blank" is a GNU
      extension from Perl 5.8. Another Perl extension is negation,
      which is indicated by a ^ character after the colon. For
      example,</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
[12[:^digit:]]
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>matches "1", "2", or any non-digit. PCRE (and Perl) also
      recognize the POSIX syntax [.ch.] and [=ch=] where "ch" is a
      "collating element", but these are not supported, and an
      error is given if they are encountered.</p>

      <p>By default, in UTF-8 mode, characters with values greater
      than 128 do not match any of the POSIX character classes.
      However, if the PCRE_UCP option is passed to <code class="function">pcre_compile</code>(), some of the classes are
      changed so that Unicode character properties are used. This
      is achieved by replacing the POSIX classes by other
      sequences, as follows:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 [:alnum:]  becomes  \p{Xan}
 [:alpha:]  becomes  \p{L}
 [:blank:]  becomes  \h
 [:digit:]  becomes  \p{Nd}
 [:lower:]  becomes  \p{Ll}
 [:space:]  becomes  \p{Xps}
 [:upper:]  becomes  \p{Lu}
 [:word:]   becomes  \p{Xwd}
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>Negated versions, such as [:^alpha:] use \P instead of \p.
      The other POSIX classes are unchanged, and match only
      characters with code points less than 128.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="refsect1" title="VERTICAL BAR">
      <a id="pcrepattern-3_sect19" name="pcrepattern-3_sect19" shape="rect"> </a>

      <h2>VERTICAL BAR</h2>

      <p>Vertical bar characters are used to separate alternative
      patterns. For example, the pattern</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
gilbert|sullivan
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>matches either "gilbert" or "sullivan". Any number of
      alternatives may appear, and an empty alternative is
      permitted (matching the empty string). The matching process
      tries each alternative in turn, from left to right, and the
      first one that succeeds is used. If the alternatives are
      within a subpattern (defined below), "succeeds" means
      matching the rest of the main pattern as well as the
      alternative in the subpattern.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="refsect1" title="INTERNAL OPTION SETTING">
      <a id="pcrepattern-3_sect20" name="pcrepattern-3_sect20" shape="rect"> </a>

      <h2>INTERNAL OPTION SETTING</h2>

      <p>The settings of the PCRE_CASELESS, PCRE_MULTILINE,
      PCRE_DOTALL, and PCRE_EXTENDED options (which are
      Perl-compatible) can be changed from within the pattern by a
      sequence of Perl option letters enclosed between "(?" and
      ")". The option letters are</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 i  for PCRE_CASELESS
 m  for PCRE_MULTILINE
 s  for PCRE_DOTALL
 x  for PCRE_EXTENDED
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>For example, (?im) sets caseless, multiline matching. It
      is also possible to unset these options by preceding the
      letter with a hyphen, and a combined setting and unsetting
      such as (?im-sx), which sets PCRE_CASELESS and PCRE_MULTILINE
      while unsetting PCRE_DOTALL and PCRE_EXTENDED, is also
      permitted. If a letter appears both before and after the
      hyphen, the option is unset.</p>

      <p>The PCRE-specific options PCRE_DUPNAMES, PCRE_UNGREEDY,
      and PCRE_EXTRA can be changed in the same way as the
      Perl-compatible options by using the characters J, U and X
      respectively.</p>

      <p>When one of these option changes occurs at top level (that
      is, not inside subpattern parentheses), the change applies to
      the remainder of the pattern that follows. If the change is
      placed right at the start of a pattern, PCRE extracts it into
      the global options (and it will therefore show up in data
      extracted by the <code class="function">pcre_fullinfo</code>() function).</p>

      <p>An option change within a subpattern (see below for a
      description of subpatterns) affects only that part of the
      subpattern that follows it, so</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(a(?i)b)c
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>matches abc and aBc and no other strings (assuming
      PCRE_CASELESS is not used). By this means, options can be
      made to have different settings in different parts of the
      pattern. Any changes made in one alternative do carry on into
      subsequent branches within the same subpattern. For
      example,</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(a(?i)b|c)
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>matches "ab", "aB", "c", and "C", even though when
      matching "C" the first branch is abandoned before the option
      setting. This is because the effects of option settings
      happen at compile time. There would be some very weird
      behaviour otherwise.</p>

      <h2>SUBPATTERNS</h2>

      <p>Subpatterns are delimited by parentheses (round brackets),
      which can be nested. Turning part of a pattern into a
      subpattern does two things:</p>

      <p>1. It localizes a set of alternatives. For example, the
      pattern</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
cat(aract|erpillar|)
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>matches "cataract", "caterpillar", or "cat". Without the
      parentheses, it would match "cataract", "erpillar" or an
      empty string.</p>

      <p>2. It sets up the subpattern as a capturing subpattern.
      This means that, when the whole pattern matches, that portion
      of the subject string that matched the subpattern is passed
      back to the caller via the <em class="parameter"><code>ovector</code></em> argument of
      <code class="function">pcre_exec</code>(). Opening
      parentheses are counted from left to right (starting from 1)
      to obtain numbers for the capturing subpatterns. For example,
      if the string "the red king" is matched against the
      pattern</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
the ((red|white) (king|queen))
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>the captured substrings are "red king", "red", and "king",
      and are numbered 1, 2, and 3, respectively.</p>

      <p>The fact that plain parentheses fulfil two functions is
      not always helpful. There are often times when a grouping
      subpattern is required without a capturing requirement. If an
      opening parenthesis is followed by a question mark and a
      colon, the subpattern does not do any capturing, and is not
      counted when computing the number of any subsequent capturing
      subpatterns. For example, if the string "the white queen" is
      matched against the pattern</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
the ((?:red|white) (king|queen))
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>the captured substrings are "white queen" and "queen", and
      are numbered 1 and 2. The maximum number of capturing
      subpatterns is 65535.</p>

      <p>As a convenient shorthand, if any option settings are
      required at the start of a non-capturing subpattern, the
      option letters may appear between the "?" and the ":". Thus
      the two patterns</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 (?i:saturday|sunday)
 (?:(?i)saturday|sunday)
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>match exactly the same set of strings. Because alternative
      branches are tried from left to right, and options are not
      reset until the end of the subpattern is reached, an option
      setting in one branch does affect subsequent branches, so the
      above patterns match "SUNDAY" as well as "Saturday".</p>

      <h2>DUPLICATE SUBPATTERN NUMBERS</h2>

      <p>Perl 5.10 introduced a feature whereby each alternative in
      a subpattern uses the same numbers for its capturing
      parentheses. Such a subpattern starts with (?| and is itself
      a non-capturing subpattern. For example, consider this
      pattern:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(?|(Sat)ur|(Sun))day
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>Because the two alternatives are inside a (?| group, both
      sets of capturing parentheses are numbered one. Thus, when
      the pattern matches, you can look at captured substring
      number one, whichever alternative matched. This construct is
      useful when you want to capture part, but not all, of one of
      a number of alternatives. Inside a (?| group, parentheses are
      numbered as usual, but the number is reset at the start of
      each branch. The numbers of any capturing parentheses that
      follow the subpattern start after the highest number used in
      any branch. The following example is taken from the Perl
      documentation. The numbers underneath show in which buffer
      the captured content will be stored.</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 # before  ---------------branch-reset----------- after
 / ( a )  (?| x ( y ) z | (p (q) r) | (t) u (v) ) ( z ) /x
 # 1            2         2  3        2     3     4
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>A back reference to a numbered subpattern uses the most
      recent value that is set for that number by any subpattern.
      The following pattern matches "abcabc" or "defdef":</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
/(?|(abc)|(def))\1/
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>In contrast, a recursive or "subroutine" call to a
      numbered subpattern always refers to the first one in the
      pattern with the given number. The following pattern matches
      "abcabc" or "defabc":</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
/(?|(abc)|(def))(?1)/
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>If a condition test for a subpattern's having matched
      refers to a non-unique number, the test is true if any of the
      subpatterns of that number have matched.</p>

      <p>An alternative approach to using this "branch reset"
      feature is to use duplicate named subpatterns, as described
      in the next section.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="refsect1" title="NAMED SUBPATTERNS">

      <h2>NAMED SUBPATTERNS</h2>

      <p>Identifying capturing parentheses by number is simple, but
      it can be very hard to keep track of the numbers in
      complicated regular expressions. Furthermore, if an
      expression is modified, the numbers may change. To help with
      this difficulty, PCRE supports the naming of subpatterns.
      This feature was not added to Perl until release 5.10. Python
      had the feature earlier, and PCRE introduced it at release
      4.0, using the Python syntax. PCRE now supports both the Perl
      and the Python syntax. Perl allows identically numbered
      subpatterns to have different names, but PCRE does not.</p>

      <p>In PCRE, a subpattern can be named in one of three ways:
      (?&lt;name&gt;...) or (?'name'...) as in Perl, or
      (?P&lt;name&gt;...) as in Python. References to capturing
      parentheses from other parts of the pattern, such as back
      references, recursion, and conditions, can be made by name as
      well as by number.</p>

      <p>Names consist of up to 32 alphanumeric characters and
      underscores. Named capturing parentheses are still allocated
      numbers as well as names, exactly as if the names were not
      present. The PCRE API provides function calls for extracting
      the name-to-number translation table from a compiled pattern.
      There is also a convenience function for extracting a
      captured substring by name.</p>

      <p>By default, a name must be unique within a pattern, but it
      is possible to relax this constraint by setting the
      PCRE_DUPNAMES option at compile time. (Duplicate names are
      also always permitted for subpatterns with the same number,
      set up as described in the previous section.) Duplicate names
      can be useful for patterns where only one instance of the
      named parentheses can match. Suppose you want to match the
      name of a weekday, either as a 3-letter abbreviation or as
      the full name, and in both cases you want to extract the
      abbreviation. This pattern (ignoring the line breaks) does
      the job:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 (?&lt;DN&gt;Mon|Fri|Sun)(?:day)?|
 (?&lt;DN&gt;Tue)(?:sday)?|
 (?&lt;DN&gt;Wed)(?:nesday)?|
 (?&lt;DN&gt;Thu)(?:rsday)?|
 (?&lt;DN&gt;Sat)(?:urday)?
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>There are five capturing substrings, but only one is ever
      set after a match. (An alternative way of solving this
      problem is to use a "branch reset" subpattern, as described
      in the previous section.)</p>

      <p>The convenience function for extracting the data by name
      returns the substring for the first (and in this example, the
      only) subpattern of that name that matched. This saves
      searching to find which numbered subpattern it was.</p>

      <p>If you make a back reference to a non-unique named
      subpattern from elsewhere in the pattern, the one that
      corresponds to the first occurrence of the name is used. In
      the absence of duplicate numbers (see the previous section)
      this is the one with the lowest number. If you use a named
      reference in a condition test (see the section about
      conditions below), either to check whether a subpattern has
      matched, or to check for recursion, all subpatterns with the
      same name are tested. If the condition is true for any one of
      them, the overall condition is true. This is the same
      behaviour as testing by number. For further details of the
      interfaces for handling named subpatterns, see the <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcreapi.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcreapi</span>(3)</span></a>

      <a id="pcrepattern-3_sect24" name="pcrepattern-3_sect24" shape="rect"> </a>

      <h2>REPETITION</h2>

      <p>Repetition is specified by quantifiers, which can follow
      any of the following items:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 a literal data character
 the dot metacharacter
 the \C escape sequence
 the \X escape sequence (in UTF-8 mode with Unicode properties)
 the \R escape sequence
 an escape such as \d or \pL that matches a single character
 a character class
 a back reference (see next section)
 a parenthesized subpattern (unless it is an assertion)
 a recursive or "subroutine" call to a subpattern
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>The general repetition quantifier specifies a minimum and
      maximum number of permitted matches, by giving the two
      numbers in curly brackets (braces), separated by a comma. The
      numbers must be less than 65536, and the first must be less
      than or equal to the second. For example:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
z{2,4}
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>matches "zz", "zzz", or "zzzz". A closing brace on its own
      is not a special character. If the second number is omitted,
      but the comma is present, there is no upper limit; if the
      second number and the comma are both omitted, the quantifier
      specifies an exact number of required matches. Thus</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
[aeiou]{3,}
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>matches at least 3 successive vowels, but may match many
      more, while</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
\d{8}
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>matches exactly 8 digits. An opening curly bracket that
      appears in a position where a quantifier is not allowed, or
      one that does not match the syntax of a quantifier, is taken
      as a literal character. For example, {,6} is not a
      quantifier, but a literal string of four characters.</p>

      <p>In UTF-8 mode, quantifiers apply to UTF-8 characters
      rather than to individual bytes. Thus, for example,
      \x{100}{2} matches two UTF-8 characters, each of which is
      represented by a two-byte sequence. Similarly, when Unicode
      property support is available, \X{3} matches three Unicode
      extended sequences, each of which may be several bytes long
      (and they may be of different lengths).</p>

      <p>The quantifier {0} is permitted, causing the expression to
      behave as if the previous item and the quantifier were not
      present. This may be useful for subpatterns that are
      referenced as subroutines from elsewhere in the pattern (but
      see also the section entitled "Defining subpatterns for use
      by reference only" below). Items other than subpatterns that
      have a {0} quantifier are omitted from the compiled
      pattern.</p>

      <p>For convenience, the three most common quantifiers have
      single-character abbreviations:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 *    is equivalent to {0,}
 +    is equivalent to {1,}
 ?    is equivalent to {0,1}
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>It is possible to construct infinite loops by following a
      subpattern that can match no characters with a quantifier
      that has no upper limit, for example:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(a?)*
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>Earlier versions of Perl and PCRE used to give an error at
      compile time for such patterns. However, because there are
      cases where this can be useful, such patterns are now
      accepted, but if any repetition of the subpattern does in
      fact match no characters, the loop is forcibly broken.</p>

      <p>By default, the quantifiers are "greedy", that is, they
      match as much as possible (up to the maximum number of
      permitted times), without causing the rest of the pattern to
      fail. The classic example of where this gives problems is in
      trying to match comments in C programs. These appear between
      /* and */ and within the comment, individual * and /
      characters may appear. An attempt to match C comments by
      applying the pattern</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
/\*.*\*/
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>to the string</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
/* first comment */  not comment  /* second comment */
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>fails, because it matches the entire string owing to the
      greediness of the .* item.</p>

      <p>However, if a quantifier is followed by a question mark,
      it ceases to be greedy, and instead matches the minimum
      number of times possible, so the pattern</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
/\*.*?\*/
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>does the right thing with the C comments. The meaning of
      the various quantifiers is not otherwise changed, just the
      preferred number of matches. Do not confuse this use of
      question mark with its use as a quantifier in its own right.
      Because it has two uses, it can sometimes appear doubled, as
      in</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
\d??\d
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>which matches one digit by preference, but can match two
      if that is the only way the rest of the pattern matches.</p>

      <p>If the PCRE_UNGREEDY option is set (an option that is not
      available in Perl), the quantifiers are not greedy by
      default, but individual ones can be made greedy by following
      them with a question mark. In other words, it inverts the
      default behaviour.</p>

      <p>When a parenthesized subpattern is quantified with a
      minimum repeat count that is greater than 1 or with a limited
      maximum, more memory is required for the compiled pattern, in
      proportion to the size of the minimum or maximum.</p>

      <p>If a pattern starts with .* or .{0,} and the PCRE_DOTALL
      option (equivalent to Perl's /s) is set, thus allowing the
      dot to match newlines, the pattern is implicitly anchored,
      because whatever follows will be tried against every
      character position in the subject string, so there is no
      point in retrying the overall match at any position after the
      first. PCRE normally treats such a pattern as though it were
      preceded by \A.</p>

      <p>In cases where it is known that the subject string
      contains no newlines, it is worth setting PCRE_DOTALL in
      order to obtain this optimization, or alternatively using ^
      to indicate anchoring explicitly.</p>

      <p>However, there is one situation where the optimization
      cannot be used. When .* is inside capturing parentheses that
      are the subject of a back reference elsewhere in the pattern,
      a match at the start may fail where a later one succeeds.
      Consider, for example:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(.*)abc\1
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>If the subject is "xyz123abc123" the match point is the
      fourth character. For this reason, such a pattern is not
      implicitly anchored.</p>

      <p>When a capturing subpattern is repeated, the value
      captured is the substring that matched the final iteration.
      For example, after</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(tweedle[dume]{3}\s*)+
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>has matched "tweedledum tweedledee" the value of the
      captured substring is "tweedledee". However, if there are
      nested capturing subpatterns, the corresponding captured
      values may have been set in previous iterations. For example,
      after</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
/(a|(b))+/
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>matches "aba" the value of the second captured substring
      is "b".</p>
    </div>

    <div class="refsect1" title="ATOMIC GROUPING AND POSSESSIVE QUANTIFIERS">
      <a id="pcrepattern-3_sect25" name="pcrepattern-3_sect25" shape="rect"> </a>

      <h2>ATOMIC GROUPING AND POSSESSIVE QUANTIFIERS</h2>

      <p>With both maximizing ("greedy") and minimizing ("ungreedy"
      or "lazy") repetition, failure of what follows normally
      causes the repeated item to be re-evaluated to see if a
      different number of repeats allows the rest of the pattern to
      match. Sometimes it is useful to prevent this, either to
      change the nature of the match, or to cause it fail earlier
      than it otherwise might, when the author of the pattern knows
      there is no point in carrying on.</p>

      <p>Consider, for example, the pattern \d+foo when applied to
      the subject line</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
123456bar
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>After matching all 6 digits and then failing to match
      "foo", the normal action of the matcher is to try again with
      only 5 digits matching the \d+ item, and then with 4, and so
      on, before ultimately failing. "Atomic grouping" (a term
      taken from Jeffrey Friedl's book) provides the means for
      specifying that once a subpattern has matched, it is not to
      be re-evaluated in this way.</p>

      <p>If we use atomic grouping for the previous example, the
      matcher gives up immediately on failing to match "foo" the
      first time. The notation is a kind of special parenthesis,
      starting with (?&gt; as in this example:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(?&gt;\d+)foo
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>This kind of parenthesis "locks up" the part of the
      pattern it contains once it has matched, and a failure
      further into the pattern is prevented from backtracking into
      it. Backtracking past it to previous items, however, works as
      normal.</p>

      <p>An alternative description is that a subpattern of this
      type matches the string of characters that an identical
      standalone pattern would match, if anchored at the current
      point in the subject string.</p>

      <p>Atomic grouping subpatterns are not capturing subpatterns.
      Simple cases such as the above example can be thought of as a
      maximizing repeat that must swallow everything it can. So,
      while both \d+ and \d+? are prepared to adjust the number of
      digits they match in order to make the rest of the pattern
      match, (?&gt;\d+) can only match an entire sequence of
      digits.</p>

      <p>Atomic groups in general can of course contain arbitrarily
      complicated subpatterns, and can be nested. However, when the
      subpattern for an atomic group is just a single repeated
      item, as in the example above, a simpler notation, called a
      "possessive quantifier" can be used. This consists of an
      additional + character following a quantifier. Using this
      notation, the previous example can be rewritten as</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
\d++foo
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>Note that a possessive quantifier can be used with an
      entire group, for example:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(abc|xyz){2,3}+
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>Possessive quantifiers are always greedy; the setting of
      the PCRE_UNGREEDY option is ignored. They are a convenient
      notation for the simpler forms of atomic group. However,
      there is no difference in the meaning of a possessive
      quantifier and the equivalent atomic group, though there may
      be a performance difference; possessive quantifiers should be
      slightly faster.</p>

      <p>The possessive quantifier syntax is an extension to the
      Perl 5.8 syntax. Jeffrey Friedl originated the idea (and the
      name) in the first edition of his book. Mike McCloskey liked
      it, so implemented it when he built Sun's Java package, and
      PCRE copied it from there. It ultimately found its way into
      Perl at release 5.10.</p>

      <p>PCRE has an optimization that automatically "possessifies"
      certain simple pattern constructs. For example, the sequence
      A+B is treated as A++B because there is no point in
      backtracking into a sequence of A's when B must follow.</p>

      <p>When a pattern contains an unlimited repeat inside a
      subpattern that can itself be repeated an unlimited number of
      times, the use of an atomic group is the only way to avoid
      some failing matches taking a very long time indeed. The
      pattern</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(\D+|&lt;\d+&gt;)*[!?]
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>matches an unlimited number of substrings that either
      consist of non-digits, or digits enclosed in &lt;&gt;,
      followed by either ! or ?. When it matches, it runs quickly.
      However, if it is applied to</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>it takes a long time before reporting failure. This is
      because the string can be divided between the internal \D+
      repeat and the external * repeat in a large number of ways,
      and all have to be tried. (The example uses [!?] rather than
      a single character at the end, because both PCRE and Perl
      have an optimization that allows for fast failure when a
      single character is used. They remember the last single
      character that is required for a match, and fail early if it
      is not present in the string.) If the pattern is changed so
      that it uses an atomic group, like this:</p>

      <h2>BACK REFERENCES</h2>

      <p>Outside a character class, a backslash followed by a digit
      greater than 0 (and possibly further digits) is a back
      reference to a capturing subpattern earlier (that is, to its
      left) in the pattern, provided there have been that many
      previous capturing left parentheses.</p>

      <p>However, if the decimal number following the backslash is
      less than 10, it is always taken as a back reference, and
      causes an error only if there are not that many capturing
      left parentheses in the entire pattern. In other words, the
      parentheses that are referenced need not be to the left of
      the reference for numbers less than 10. A "forward back
      reference" of this type can make sense when a repetition is
      involved and the subpattern to the right has participated in
      an earlier iteration.</p>

      <p>It is not possible to have a numerical "forward back
      reference" to a subpattern whose number is 10 or more using
      this syntax because a sequence such as \50 is interpreted as
      a character defined in octal. See the subsection entitled
      "Non-printing characters" above for further details of the
      handling of digits following a backslash. There is no such
      problem when named parentheses are used. A back reference to
      any subpattern is possible using named parentheses (see
      below).</p>

      <p>Another way of avoiding the ambiguity inherent in the use
      of digits following a backslash is to use the \g escape
      sequence. This escape must be followed by an unsigned number
      or a negative number, optionally enclosed in braces. These
      examples are all identical:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 (ring), \1
 (ring), \g1
 (ring), \g{1}
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>An unsigned number specifies an absolute reference without
      the ambiguity that is present in the older syntax. It is also
      useful when literal digits follow the reference. A negative
      number is a relative reference. Consider this example:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(abc(def)ghi)\g{-1}
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>The sequence \g{-1} is a reference to the most recently
      started capturing subpattern before \g, that is, is it
      equivalent to \2 in this example. Similarly, \g{-2} would be
      equivalent to \1. The use of relative references can be
      helpful in long patterns, and also in patterns that are
      created by joining together fragments that contain references
      within themselves.</p>

      <p>A back reference matches whatever actually matched the
      capturing subpattern in the current subject string, rather
      than anything matching the subpattern itself (see
      "Subpatterns as subroutines" below for a way of doing that).
      So the pattern</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(sens|respons)e and \1ibility
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>matches "sense and sensibility" and "response and
      responsibility", but not "sense and responsibility". If
      caseful matching is in force at the time of the back
      reference, the case of letters is relevant. For example,</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
((?i)rah)\s+\1
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>matches "rah rah" and "RAH RAH", but not "RAH rah", even
      though the original capturing subpattern is matched
      caselessly.</p>

      <p>There are several different ways of writing back
      references to named subpatterns. The .NET syntax \k{name} and
      the Perl syntax \k&lt;name&gt; or \k'name' are supported, as
      is the Python syntax (?P=name). Perl 5.10's unified back
      reference syntax, in which \g can be used for both numeric
      and named references, is also supported. We could rewrite the
      above example in any of the following ways:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 (?&lt;p1&gt;(?i)rah)\s+\k&lt;p1&gt;
 (?'p1'(?i)rah)\s+\k{p1}
 (?P&lt;p1&gt;(?i)rah)\s+(?P=p1)
 (?&lt;p1&gt;(?i)rah)\s+\g{p1}
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>A subpattern that is referenced by name may appear in the
      pattern before or after the reference.</p>

      <p>There may be more than one back reference to the same
      subpattern. If a subpattern has not actually been used in a
      particular match, any back references to it always fail by
      default. For example, the pattern</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(a|(bc))\2
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>always fails if it starts to match "a" rather than "bc".
      However, if the PCRE_JAVASCRIPT_COMPAT option is set at
      compile time, a back reference to an unset value matches an
      empty string.</p>

      <p>Because there may be many capturing parentheses in a
      pattern, all digits following a backslash are taken as part
      of a potential back reference number. If the pattern
      continues with a digit character, some delimiter must be used
      to terminate the back reference. If the PCRE_EXTENDED option
      is set, this can be whitespace. Otherwise, the \g{ syntax or
      an empty comment (see "Comments" below) can be used.</p>

      <div class="refsect2" title="Recursive back references">
        <a id="pcrepattern-3_sect27" name="pcrepattern-3_sect27" shape="rect"> </a>

        <h3>Recursive back references</h3>

        <p>A back reference that occurs inside the parentheses to
        which it refers fails when the subpattern is first used,
        so, for example, (a\1) never matches. However, such
        references can be useful inside repeated subpatterns. For
        example, the pattern</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(a|b\1)+
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>matches any number of "a"s and also "aba", "ababbaa"
        etc. At each iteration of the subpattern, the back
        reference matches the character string corresponding to the
        previous iteration. In order for this to work, the pattern
        must be such that the first iteration does not need to
        match the back reference. This can be done using
        alternation, as in the example above, or by a quantifier
        with a minimum of zero.</p>

        <p>Back references of this type cause the group that they
        reference to be treated as an atomic group. Once the whole
        group has been matched, a subsequent matching failure
        cannot cause backtracking into the middle of the group.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="refsect1" title="ASSERTIONS">
      <a id="pcrepattern-3_sect28" name="pcrepattern-3_sect28" shape="rect"> </a>

      <h2>ASSERTIONS</h2>

      <p>An assertion is a test on the characters following or
      preceding the current matching point that does not actually
      consume any characters. The simple assertions coded as \b,
      \B, \A, \G, \Z, \z, ^ and $ are described above.</p>

      <p>More complicated assertions are coded as subpatterns.
      There are two kinds: those that look ahead of the current
      position in the subject string, and those that look behind
      it. An assertion subpattern is matched in the normal way,
      except that it does not cause the current matching position
      to be changed.</p>

      <p>Assertion subpatterns are not capturing subpatterns, and
      may not be repeated, because it makes no sense to assert the
      same thing several times. If any kind of assertion contains
      capturing subpatterns within it, these are counted for the
      purposes of numbering the capturing subpatterns in the whole
      pattern. However, substring capturing is carried out only for
      positive assertions, because it does not make sense for
      negative assertions.</p>

      <div class="refsect2" title="Lookahead assertions">
        <a id="pcrepattern-3_sect29" name="pcrepattern-3_sect29" shape="rect"> </a>

        <h3>Lookahead assertions</h3>

        <p>Lookahead assertions start with (?= for positive
        assertions and (?! for negative assertions. For
        example,</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
\w+(?=;)
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>matches a word followed by a semicolon, but does not
        include the semicolon in the match, and</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
foo(?!bar)
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>matches any occurrence of "foo" that is not followed by
        "bar". Note that the apparently similar pattern</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(?!foo)bar
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>does not find an occurrence of "bar" that is preceded by
        something other than "foo"; it finds any occurrence of
        "bar" whatsoever, because the assertion (?!foo) is always
        true when the next three characters are "bar". A lookbehind
        assertion is needed to achieve the other effect.</p>

        <p>If you want to force a matching failure at some point in
        a pattern, the most convenient way to do it is with (?!)
        because an empty string always matches, so an assertion
        that requires there not to be an empty string must always
        fail. The backtracking control verb (*FAIL) or (*F) is a
        synonym for (?!).</p>
      </div>

      <div class="refsect2" title="Lookbehind assertions">
        <a id="pcrepattern-3_sect30" name="pcrepattern-3_sect30" shape="rect"> </a>

        <h3>Lookbehind assertions</h3>

        <p>Lookbehind assertions start with (?&lt;= for positive
        assertions and (?&lt;! for negative assertions. For
        example,</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(?&lt;!foo)bar
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>does find an occurrence of "bar" that is not preceded by
        "foo". The contents of a lookbehind assertion are
        restricted such that all the strings it matches must have a
        fixed length. However, if there are several top-level
        alternatives, they do not all have to have the same fixed
        length. Thus</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(?&lt;=bullock|donkey)
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>is permitted, but</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(?&lt;!dogs?|cats?)
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>causes an error at compile time. Branches that match
        different length strings are permitted only at the top
        level of a lookbehind assertion. This is an extension
        compared with Perl, which requires all branches to match
        the same length of string. An assertion such as</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(?&lt;=ab(c|de))
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>is not permitted, because its single top-level branch
        can match two different lengths, but it is acceptable to
        PCRE if rewritten to use two top-level branches:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(?&lt;=abc|abde)
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>In some cases, the escape sequence \K (see above) can be
        used instead of a lookbehind assertion to get round the
        fixed-length restriction.</p>

        <p>The implementation of lookbehind assertions is, for each
        alternative, to temporarily move the current position back
        by the fixed length and then try to match. If there are
        insufficient characters before the current position, the
        assertion fails.</p>

        <p>PCRE does not allow the \C escape (which matches a
        single byte in UTF-8 mode) to appear in lookbehind
        assertions, because it makes it impossible to calculate the
        length of the lookbehind. The \X and \R escapes, which can
        match different numbers of bytes, are also not
        permitted.</p>

        <p>"Subroutine" calls (see below) such as (?2) or (?&amp;X)
        are permitted in lookbehinds, as long as the subpattern
        matches a fixed-length string. Recursion, however, is not
        supported.</p>

        <p>Possessive quantifiers can be used in conjunction with
        lookbehind assertions to specify efficient matching of
        fixed-length strings at the end of subject strings.
        Consider a simple pattern such as</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
abcd$
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>when applied to a long string that does not match.
        Because matching proceeds from left to right, PCRE will
        look for each "a" in the subject and then see if what
        follows matches the rest of the pattern. If the pattern is
        specified as</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
^.*abcd$
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>the initial .* matches the entire string at first, but
        when this fails (because there is no following "a"), it
        backtracks to match all but the last character, then all
        but the last two characters, and so on. Once again the
        search for "a" covers the entire string, from right to
        left, so we are no better off. However, if the pattern is
        written as</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
^.*+(?&lt;=abcd)
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>there can be no backtracking for the .*+ item; it can
        match only the entire string. The subsequent lookbehind
        assertion does a single test on the last four characters.
        If it fails, the match fails immediately. For long strings,
        this approach makes a significant difference to the
        processing time.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="refsect2" title="Using multiple assertions">
        <a id="pcrepattern-3_sect31" name="pcrepattern-3_sect31" shape="rect"> </a>

        <h3>Using multiple assertions</h3>

        <p>Several assertions (of any sort) may occur in
        succession. For example,</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(?&lt;=\d{3})(?&lt;!999)foo
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>matches "foo" preceded by three digits that are not
        "999". Notice that each of the assertions is applied
        independently at the same point in the subject string.
        First there is a check that the previous three characters
        are all digits, and then there is a check that the same
        three characters are not "999". This pattern does
        <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> match "foo"
        preceded by six characters, the first of which are digits
        and the last three of which are not "999". For example, it
        doesn't match "123abcfoo". A pattern to do that is</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(?&lt;=\d{3}...)(?&lt;!999)foo
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>This time the first assertion looks at the preceding six
        characters, checking that the first three are digits, and
        then the second assertion checks that the preceding three
        characters are not "999".</p>

        <p>Assertions can be nested in any combination. For
        example,</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(?&lt;=(?&lt;!foo)bar)baz
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>matches an occurrence of "baz" that is preceded by "bar"
        which in turn is not preceded by "foo", while</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(?&lt;=\d{3}(?!999)...)foo
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>is another pattern that matches "foo" preceded by three
        digits and any three characters that are not "999".</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="refsect1" title="CONDITIONAL SUBPATTERNS">
      <a id="pcrepattern-3_sect32" name="pcrepattern-3_sect32" shape="rect"> </a>

      <h2>CONDITIONAL SUBPATTERNS</h2>

      <p>It is possible to cause the matching process to obey a
      subpattern conditionally or to choose between two alternative
      subpatterns, depending on the result of an assertion, or
      whether a specific capturing subpattern has already been
      matched. The two possible forms of conditional subpattern
      are:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 (?(condition)yes-pattern)
 (?(condition)yes-pattern|no-pattern)
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>If the condition is satisfied, the yes-pattern is used;
      otherwise the no-pattern (if present) is used. If there are
      more than two alternatives in the subpattern, a compile-time
      error occurs. Each of the two alternatives may itself contain
      nested subpatterns of any form, including conditional
      subpatterns; the restriction to two alternatives applies only
      at the level of the condition. This pattern fragment is an
      example where the alternatives are complex:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(?(1) (A|B|C) | (D | (?(2)E|F) | E) )
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>There are four kinds of condition: references to
      subpatterns, references to recursion, a pseudo-condition
      called DEFINE, and assertions.</p>

      <div class="refsect2" title="Checking for a used subpattern by number">
        <a id="pcrepattern-3_sect33" name="pcrepattern-3_sect33" shape="rect"> </a>

        <h3>Checking for a used subpattern by number</h3>

        <p>If the text between the parentheses consists of a
        sequence of digits, the condition is true if a capturing
        subpattern of that number has previously matched. If there
        is more than one capturing subpattern with the same number
        (see the earlier section about duplicate subpattern
        numbers), the condition is true if any of them have
        matched. An alternative notation is to precede the digits
        with a plus or minus sign. In this case, the subpattern
        number is relative rather than absolute. The most recently
        opened parentheses can be referenced by (?(-1), the next
        most recent by (?(-2), and so on. Inside loops it can also
        make sense to refer to subsequent groups. The next
        parentheses to be opened can be referenced as (?(+1), and
        so on. (The value zero in any of these forms is not used;
        it provokes a compile-time error.)</p>

        <p>Consider the following pattern, which contains
        non-significant white space to make it more readable
        (assume the PCRE_EXTENDED option) and to divide it into
        three parts for ease of discussion:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
( \( )?    [^()]+    (?(1) \) )
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>The first part matches an optional opening parenthesis,
        and if that character is present, sets it as the first
        captured substring. The second part matches one or more
        characters that are not parentheses. The third part is a
        conditional subpattern that tests whether or not the first
        set of parentheses matched. If they did, that is, if
        subject started with an opening parenthesis, the condition
        is true, and so the yes-pattern is executed and a closing
        parenthesis is required. Otherwise, since no-pattern is not
        present, the subpattern matches nothing. In other words,
        this pattern matches a sequence of non-parentheses,
        optionally enclosed in parentheses.</p>

        <p>If you were embedding this pattern in a larger one, you
        could use a relative reference:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
...other stuff... ( \( )?    [^()]+    (?(-1) \) ) ...
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>This makes the fragment independent of the parentheses
        in the larger pattern.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="refsect2" title="Checking for a used subpattern by name">
        <a id="pcrepattern-3_sect34" name="pcrepattern-3_sect34" shape="rect"> </a>

        <h3>Checking for a used subpattern by name</h3>

        <p>Perl uses the syntax (?(&lt;name&gt;)...) or
        (?('name')...) to test for a used subpattern by name. For
        compatibility with earlier versions of PCRE, which had this
        facility before Perl, the syntax (?(name)...) is also
        recognized. However, there is a possible ambiguity with
        this syntax, because subpattern names may consist entirely
        of digits. PCRE looks first for a named subpattern; if it
        cannot find one and the name consists entirely of digits,
        PCRE looks for a subpattern of that number, which must be
        greater than zero. Using subpattern names that consist
        entirely of digits is not recommended.</p>

        <p>Rewriting the above example to use a named subpattern
        gives this:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(?&lt;OPEN&gt; \( )?    [^()]+    (?(&lt;OPEN&gt;) \) )
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>If the name used in a condition of this kind is a
        duplicate, the test is applied to all subpatterns of the
        same name, and is true if any one of them has matched.</p>
      </div>

        <a id="pcrepattern-3_sect35" name="pcrepattern-3_sect35" shape="rect"> </a>

        <h3>Checking for pattern recursion</h3>

        <p>If the condition is the string (R), and there is no
        subpattern with the name R, the condition is true if a
        recursive call to the whole pattern or any subpattern has
        been made. If digits or a name preceded by ampersand follow
        the letter R, for example:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(?(R3)...) or (?(R&amp;name)...)
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>the condition is true if the most recent recursion is
        into a subpattern whose number or name is given. This
        condition does not check the entire recursion stack. If the
        name used in a condition of this kind is a duplicate, the
        test is applied to all subpatterns of the same name, and is
        true if any one of them is the most recent recursion.</p>

        <p>At "top level", all these recursion test conditions are
        false. The syntax for recursive patterns is described
        below.</p>

        <a id="pcrepattern-3_sect36" name="pcrepattern-3_sect36" shape="rect"> </a>

        <h3>Defining subpatterns for use by reference only</h3>

        <p>If the condition is the string (DEFINE), and there is no
        subpattern with the name DEFINE, the condition is always
        false. In this case, there may be only one alternative in
        the subpattern. It is always skipped if control reaches
        this point in the pattern; the idea of DEFINE is that it
        can be used to define "subroutines" that can be referenced
        from elsewhere. (The use of "subroutines" is described
        below.) For example, a pattern to match an IPv4 address
        such as "192.168.23.245" could be written like this (ignore
        whitespace and line breaks):</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 (?(DEFINE) (?&lt;byte&gt; 2[0-4]\d | 25[0-5] | 1\d\d | [1-9]?\d) )
 \b (?&amp;byte) (\.(?&amp;byte)){3} \b
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>The first part of the pattern is a DEFINE group inside
        which a another group named "byte" is defined. This matches
        an individual component of an IPv4 address (a number less
        than 256). When matching takes place, this part of the
        pattern is skipped because DEFINE acts like a false
        condition. The rest of the pattern uses references to the
        named group to match the four dot-separated components of
        an IPv4 address, insisting on a word boundary at each
        end.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="refsect2" title="Assertion conditions">
        <a id="pcrepattern-3_sect37" name="pcrepattern-3_sect37" shape="rect"> </a>

        <h3>Assertion conditions</h3>

        <p>If the condition is not in any of the above formats, it
        must be an assertion. This may be a positive or negative
        lookahead or lookbehind assertion. Consider this pattern,
        again containing non-significant white space, and with the
        two alternatives on the second line:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 (?(?=[^a-z]*[a-z])
 \d{2}-[a-z]{3}-\d{2}  |  \d{2}-\d{2}-\d{2} )
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>The condition is a positive lookahead assertion that
        matches an optional sequence of non-letters followed by a
        letter. In other words, it tests for the presence of at
        least one letter in the subject. If a letter is found, the
        subject is matched against the first alternative; otherwise
        it is matched against the second. This pattern matches
        strings in one of the two forms dd-aaa-dd or dd-dd-dd,
        where aaa are letters and dd are digits.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="refsect1" title="COMMENTS">
      <a id="pcrepattern-3_sect38" name="pcrepattern-3_sect38" shape="rect"> </a>

      <h2>COMMENTS</h2>

      <p>There are two ways of including comments in patterns that
      are processed by PCRE. In both cases, the start of the
      comment must not be in a character class, nor in the middle
      of any other sequence of related characters such as (?: or a
      subpattern name or number. The characters that make up a
      comment play no part in the pattern matching.</p>

      <p>The sequence (?# marks the start of a comment that
      continues up to the next closing parenthesis. Nested
      parentheses are not permitted. If the PCRE_EXTENDED option is
      set, an unescaped # character also introduces a comment,
      which in this case continues to immediately after the next
      newline character or character sequence in the pattern. Which
      characters are interpreted as newlines is controlled by the
      options passed to <code class="function">pcre_compile</code>() or by a special sequence at
      the start of the pattern, as described in the section
      entitled "Newline conventions" above. Note that the end of
      this type of comment is a literal newline sequence in the
      pattern; escape sequences that happen to represent a newline
      do not count. For example, consider this pattern when
      PCRE_EXTENDED is set, and the default newline convention is
      in force:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
abc #comment \n still comment
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>On encountering the # character, <code class="function">pcre_compile</code>() skips along, looking for a
      newline in the pattern. The sequence \n is still literal at
      this stage, so it does not terminate the comment. Only an
      actual character with the code value 0x0a (the default
      newline) does so.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="refsect1" title="RECURSIVE PATTERNS">
      <a id="pcrepattern-3_sect39" name="pcrepattern-3_sect39" shape="rect"> </a>

      <h2>RECURSIVE PATTERNS</h2>

      <p>Consider the problem of matching a string in parentheses,
      allowing for unlimited nested parentheses. Without the use of
      recursion, the best that can be done is to use a pattern that
      matches up to some fixed depth of nesting. It is not possible
      to handle an arbitrary nesting depth.</p>

      <p>For some time, Perl has provided a facility that allows
      regular expressions to recurse (amongst other things). It
      does this by interpolating Perl code in the expression at run
      time, and the code can refer to the expression itself. A Perl
      pattern using code interpolation to solve the parentheses
      problem can be created like this:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
$re = qr{\( (?: (?&gt;[^()]+) | (?p{$re}) )* \)}x;
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>The (?p{...}) item interpolates Perl code at run time, and
      in this case refers recursively to the pattern in which it
      appears.</p>

      <p>Obviously, PCRE cannot support the interpolation of Perl
      code. Instead, it supports special syntax for recursion of
      the entire pattern, and also for individual subpattern
      recursion. After its introduction in PCRE and Python, this
      kind of recursion was subsequently introduced into Perl at
      release 5.10.</p>

      <p>A special item that consists of (? followed by a number
      greater than zero and a closing parenthesis is a recursive
      call of the subpattern of the given number, provided that it
      occurs inside that subpattern. (If not, it is a "subroutine"
      call, which is described in the next section.) The special
      item (?R) or (?0) is a recursive call of the entire regular
      expression.</p>

      <p>This PCRE pattern solves the nested parentheses problem
      (assume the PCRE_EXTENDED option is set so that white space
      is ignored):</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
\( ( [^()]++ | (?R) )* \)
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>First it matches an opening parenthesis. Then it matches
      any number of substrings which can either be a sequence of
      non-parentheses, or a recursive match of the pattern itself
      (that is, a correctly parenthesized substring). Finally there
      is a closing parenthesis. Note the use of a possessive
      quantifier to avoid backtracking into sequences of
      non-parentheses.</p>

      <p>If this were part of a larger pattern, you would not want
      to recurse the entire pattern, so instead you could use
      this:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
( \( ( [^()]++ | (?1) )* \) )
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>We have put the pattern into parentheses, and caused the
      recursion to refer to them instead of the whole pattern.</p>

      <p>In a larger pattern, keeping track of parenthesis numbers
      can be tricky. This is made easier by the use of relative
      references. Instead of (?1) in the pattern above you can
      write (?-2) to refer to the second most recently opened
      parentheses preceding the recursion. In other words, a
      negative number counts capturing parentheses leftwards from
      the point at which it is encountered.</p>

      <p>It is also possible to refer to subsequently opened
      parentheses, by writing references such as (?+2). However,
      these cannot be recursive because the reference is not inside
      the parentheses that are referenced. They are always
      "subroutine" calls, as described in the next section.</p>

      <p>An alternative approach is to use named parentheses
      instead. The Perl syntax for this is (?&amp;name); PCRE's
      earlier syntax (?P&gt;name) is also supported. We could
      rewrite the above example as follows:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(?&lt;pn&gt; \( ( [^()]++ | (?&amp;pn) )* \) )
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>If there is more than one subpattern with the same name,
      the earliest one is used.</p>

      <p>This particular example pattern that we have been looking
      at contains nested unlimited repeats, and so the use of a
      possessive quantifier for matching strings of non-parentheses
      is important when applying the pattern to strings that do not
      match. For example, when this pattern is applied to</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa()
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>it yields "no match" quickly. However, if a possessive
      quantifier is not used, the match runs for a very long time
      indeed because there are so many different ways the + and *
      repeats can carve up the subject, and all have to be tested
      before failure can be reported.</p>

      <p>At the end of a match, the values of capturing parentheses
      are those from the outermost level. If you want to obtain
      intermediate values, a callout function can be used (see
      below and the <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcrecallout.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcrecallout</span>(3)</span></a>
      documentation). If the pattern above is matched against</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(ab(cd)ef)
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>the value for the inner capturing parentheses (numbered 2)
      is "ef", which is the last value taken on at the top level.
      If a capturing subpattern is not matched at the top level,
      its final value is unset, even if it is (temporarily) set at
      a deeper level.</p>

      <p>If there are more than 15 capturing parentheses in a
      pattern, PCRE has to obtain extra memory to store data during
      a recursion, which it does by using <code class="function">pcre_malloc</code>, freeing it via <code class="function">pcre_free</code> afterwards. If no memory can be
      obtained, the match fails with the PCRE_ERROR_NOMEMORY
      error.</p>

      <p>Do not confuse the (?R) item with the condition (R), which
      tests for recursion. Consider this pattern, which matches
      text in angle brackets, allowing for arbitrary nesting. Only
      digits are allowed in nested brackets (that is, when
      recursing), whereas any characters are permitted at the outer
      level.</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
&lt; (?: (?(R) \d++  | [^&lt;&gt;]*+) | (?R)) * &gt;
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>In this pattern, (?(R) is the start of a conditional
      subpattern, with two different alternatives for the recursive
      and non-recursive cases. The (?R) item is the actual
      recursive call.</p>

      <div class="refsect2" title="Recursion difference from Perl">
        <a id="pcrepattern-3_sect40" name="pcrepattern-3_sect40" shape="rect"> </a>

        <h3>Recursion difference from Perl</h3>

        <p>In PCRE (like Python, but unlike Perl), a recursive
        subpattern call is always treated as an atomic group. That
        is, once it has matched some of the subject string, it is
        never re-entered, even if it contains untried alternatives
        and there is a subsequent matching failure. This can be
        illustrated by the following pattern, which purports to
        match a palindromic string that contains an odd number of
        characters (for example, "a", "aba", "abcba",
        "abcdcba"):</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
^(.|(.)(?1)\2)$
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>The idea is that it either matches a single character,
        or two identical characters surrounding a sub-palindrome.
        In Perl, this pattern works; in PCRE it does not if the
        pattern is longer than three characters. Consider the
        subject string "abcba":</p>

        <p>At the top level, the first character is matched, but as
        it is not at the end of the string, the first alternative
        fails; the second alternative is taken and the recursion
        kicks in. The recursive call to subpattern 1 successfully
        matches the next character ("b"). (Note that the beginning
        and end of line tests are not part of the recursion).</p>

        <p>Back at the top level, the next character ("c") is
        compared with what subpattern 2 matched, which was "a".
        This fails. Because the recursion is treated as an atomic
        group, there are now no backtracking points, and so the
        entire match fails. (Perl is able, at this point, to
        re-enter the recursion and try the second alternative.)
        However, if the pattern is written with the alternatives in
        the other order, things are different:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
^((.)(?1)\2|.)$
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>This time, the recursing alternative is tried first, and
        continues to recurse until it runs out of characters, at
        which point the recursion fails. But this time we do have
        another alternative to try at the higher level. That is the
        big difference: in the previous case the remaining
        alternative is at a deeper recursion level, which PCRE
        cannot use.</p>

        <p>To change the pattern so that it matches all palindromic
        strings, not just those with an odd number of characters,
        it is tempting to change the pattern to this:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
^((.)(?1)\2|.?)$
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>Again, this works in Perl, but not in PCRE, and for the
        same reason. When a deeper recursion has matched a single
        character, it cannot be entered again in order to match an
        empty string. The solution is to separate the two cases,
        and write out the odd and even cases as alternatives at the
        higher level:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
^(?:((.)(?1)\2|)|((.)(?3)\4|.))
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>If you want to match typical palindromic phrases, the
        pattern has to ignore all non-word characters, which can be
        done like this:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
^\W*+(?:((.)\W*+(?1)\W*+\2|)|((.)\W*+(?3)\W*+\4|\W*+.\W*+))\W*+$
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>If run with the PCRE_CASELESS option, this pattern
        matches phrases such as "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama!"
        and it works well in both PCRE and Perl. Note the use of
        the possessive quantifier *+ to avoid backtracking into
        sequences of non-word characters. Without this, PCRE takes
        a great deal longer (ten times or more) to match typical
        phrases, and Perl takes so long that you think it has gone
        into a loop.</p>

        <p><code class="constant">WARNING</code>: The
        palindrome-matching patterns above work only if the subject
        string does not start with a palindrome that is shorter
        than the entire string. For example, although "abcba" is
        correctly matched, if the subject is "ababa", PCRE finds
        the palindrome "aba" at the start, then fails at top level
        because the end of the string does not follow. Once again,
        it cannot jump back into the recursion to try other
        alternatives, so the entire match fails.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

      <h2>SUBPATTERNS AS SUBROUTINES</h2>

      <p>If the syntax for a recursive subpattern reference (either
      by number or by name) is used outside the parentheses to
      which it refers, it operates like a subroutine in a
      programming language. The "called" subpattern may be defined
      before or after the reference. A numbered reference can be
      absolute or relative, as in these examples:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 (...(absolute)...)...(?2)...
 (...(relative)...)...(?-1)...
 (...(?+1)...(relative)...
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>An earlier example pointed out that the pattern</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(sens|respons)e and \1ibility
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>matches "sense and sensibility" and "response and
      responsibility", but not "sense and responsibility". If
      instead the pattern</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(sens|respons)e and (?1)ibility
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>is used, it does match "sense and responsibility" as well
      as the other two strings. Another example is given in the
      discussion of DEFINE above.</p>

      <p>Like recursive subpatterns, a subroutine call is always
      treated as an atomic group. That is, once it has matched some
      of the subject string, it is never re-entered, even if it
      contains untried alternatives and there is a subsequent
      matching failure. Any capturing parentheses that are set
      during the subroutine call revert to their previous values
      afterwards.</p>

      <p>When a subpattern is used as a subroutine, processing
      options such as case-independence are fixed when the
      subpattern is defined. They cannot be changed for different
      calls. For example, consider this pattern:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(abc)(?i:(?-1))
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>It matches "abcabc". It does not match "abcABC" because
      the change of processing option does not affect the called
      subpattern.</p>
    </div>

      <h2>ONIGURUMA SUBROUTINE SYNTAX</h2>

      <p>For compatibility with Oniguruma, the non-Perl syntax \g
      followed by a name or a number enclosed either in angle
      brackets or single quotes, is an alternative syntax for
      referencing a subpattern as a subroutine, possibly
      recursively. Here are two of the examples used above,
      rewritten using this syntax:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 (?&lt;pn&gt; \( ( (?&gt;[^()]+) | \g&lt;pn&gt; )* \) )
 (sens|respons)e and \g'1'ibility
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>PCRE supports an extension to Oniguruma: if a number is
      preceded by a plus or a minus sign it is taken as a relative
      reference. For example:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(abc)(?i:\g&lt;-1&gt;)
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>Note that \g{...} (Perl syntax) and \g&lt;...&gt;
      (Oniguruma syntax) are <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> synonymous. The former is a
      back reference; the latter is a subroutine call.</p>

      <h2>CALLOUTS</h2>

      <p>Perl has a feature whereby using the sequence (?{...})
      causes arbitrary Perl code to be obeyed in the middle of
      matching a regular expression. This makes it possible,
      amongst other things, to extract different substrings that
      match the same pair of parentheses when there is a
      repetition.</p>

      <p>PCRE provides a similar feature, but of course it cannot
      obey arbitrary Perl code. The feature is called "callout".
      The caller of PCRE provides an external function by putting
      its entry point in the global variable <code class="varname">pcre_callout</code>. By default, this variable
      contains NULL, which disables all calling out.</p>

      <p>Within a regular expression, (?C) indicates the points at
      which the external function is to be called. If you want to
      identify different callout points, you can put a number less
      than 256 after the letter C. The default value is zero. For
      example, this pattern has two callout points:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(?C1)abc(?C2)def
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>If the PCRE_AUTO_CALLOUT flag is passed to <code class="function">pcre_compile</code>(), callouts are automatically
      installed before each item in the pattern. They are all
      numbered 255.</p>

      <p>During matching, when PCRE reaches a callout point (and
      <code class="varname">pcre_callout</code> is set), the
      external function is called. It is provided with the number
      of the callout, the position in the pattern, and, optionally,
      one item of data originally supplied by the caller of
      <code class="function">pcre_exec</code>(). The callout
      function may cause matching to proceed, to backtrack, or to
      fail altogether. A complete description of the interface to
      the callout function is given in the <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcrecallout.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcrecallout</span>(3)</span></a>

      <a id="pcrepattern-3_sect44" name="pcrepattern-3_sect44" shape="rect"> </a>

      <h2>BACKTRACKING CONTROL</h2>

      <p>Perl 5.10 introduced a number of "Special Backtracking
      Control Verbs", which are described in the Perl documentation
      as "experimental and subject to change or removal in a future
      version of Perl". It goes on to say: "Their usage in
      production code should be noted to avoid problems during
      upgrades." The same remarks apply to the PCRE features
      described in this section.</p>

      <p>Since these verbs are specifically related to
      backtracking, most of them can be used only when the pattern
      is to be matched using <code class="function">pcre_exec</code>(), which uses a backtracking
      algorithm. With the exception of (*FAIL), which behaves like
      a failing negative assertion, they cause an error if
      encountered by <code class="function">pcre_dfa_exec</code>().</p>

      <p>If any of these verbs are used in an assertion or
      subroutine subpattern (including recursive subpatterns),
      their effect is confined to that subpattern; it does not
      extend to the surrounding pattern. Note that such subpatterns
      are processed as anchored at the point where they are
      tested.</p>

      <p>The new verbs make use of what was previously invalid
      syntax: an opening parenthesis followed by an asterisk. They
      are generally of the form (*VERB) or (*VERB:NAME). Some may
      take either form, with differing behaviour, depending on
      whether or not an argument is present. An name is a sequence
      of letters, digits, and underscores. If the name is empty,
      that is, if the closing parenthesis immediately follows the
      colon, the effect is as if the colon were not there. Any
      number of these verbs may occur in a pattern.</p>

      <p>PCRE contains some optimizations that are used to speed up
      matching by running some checks at the start of each match
      attempt. For example, it may know the minimum length of
      matching subject, or that a particular character must be
      present. When one of these optimizations suppresses the
      running of a match, any included backtracking verbs will not,
      of course, be processed. You can suppress the start-of-match
      optimizations by setting the PCRE_NO_START_OPTIMIZE option
      when calling <code class="function">pcre_compile</code>() or
      <code class="function">pcre_exec</code>(), or by starting the
      pattern with (*NO_START_OPT).</p>

      <div class="refsect2" title="Verbs that act immediately">
        <a id="pcrepattern-3_sect45" name="pcrepattern-3_sect45" shape="rect"> </a>

        <h3>Verbs that act immediately</h3>

        <p>The following verbs act as soon as they are encountered.
        They may not be followed by a name.</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(*ACCEPT)
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>This verb causes the match to end successfully, skipping
        the remainder of the pattern. When inside a recursion, only
        the innermost pattern is ended immediately. If (*ACCEPT) is
        inside capturing parentheses, the data so far is captured.
        (This feature was added to PCRE at release 8.00.) For
        example:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
A((?:A|B(*ACCEPT)|C)D)
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>This matches "AB", "AAD", or "ACD"; when it matches
        "AB", "B" is captured by the outer parentheses.</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(*FAIL) or (*F)
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>This verb causes the match to fail, forcing backtracking
        to occur. It is equivalent to (?!) but easier to read. The
        Perl documentation notes that it is probably useful only
        when combined with (?{}) or (??{}). Those are, of course,
        Perl features that are not present in PCRE. The nearest
        equivalent is the callout feature, as for example in this
        pattern:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
a+(?C)(*FAIL)
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>A match with the string "aaaa" always fails, but the
        callout is taken before each backtrack happens (in this
        example, 10 times).</p>
      </div>

      <div class="refsect2" title="Recording which path was taken">
        <a id="pcrepattern-3_sect46" name="pcrepattern-3_sect46" shape="rect"> </a>

        <h3>Recording which path was taken</h3>

        <p>There is one verb whose main purpose is to track how a
        match was arrived at, though it also has a secondary use in
        conjunction with advancing the match starting point (see
        (*SKIP) below).</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(*MARK:NAME) or (*:NAME)
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>A name is always required with this verb. There may be
        as many instances of (*MARK) as you like in a pattern, and
        their names do not have to be unique.</p>

        <p>When a match succeeds, the name of the last-encountered
        (*MARK) is passed back to the caller via the <code class="function">pcre_extra</code> data structure, as described
        in the section on <code class="function">pcre_extra</code>
        in the <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcreapi.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcreapi</span>(3)</span></a> documentation.
        No data is returned for a partial match. Here is an example
        of <span class="command"><strong>pcretest</strong></span>
        output, where the /K modifier requests the retrieval and
        outputting of (*MARK) data:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 /X(*MARK:A)Y|X(*MARK:B)Z/K
 XY
  0: XY
 MK: A
 XZ
  0: XZ
 MK: B
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>The (*MARK) name is tagged with "MK:" in this output,
        and in this example it indicates which of the two
        alternatives matched. This is a more efficient way of
        obtaining this information than putting each alternative in
        its own capturing parentheses.</p>

        <p>A name may also be returned after a failed match if the
        final path through the pattern involves (*MARK). However,
        unless (*MARK) used in conjunction with (*COMMIT), this is
        unlikely to happen for an unanchored pattern because, as
        the starting point for matching is advanced, the final
        check is often with an empty string, causing a failure
        before (*MARK) is reached. For example:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 /X(*MARK:A)Y|X(*MARK:B)Z/K
 XP
 No match
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>There are three potential starting points for this match
        (starting with X, starting with P, and with an empty
        string). If the pattern is anchored, the result is
        different:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 /^X(*MARK:A)Y|^X(*MARK:B)Z/K
 XP
 No match, mark = B
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>PCRE's start-of-match optimizations can also interfere
        with this. For example, if, as a result of a call to
        <code class="function">pcre_study</code>(), it knows the
        minimum subject length for a match, a shorter subject will
        not be scanned at all.</p>

        <p>Note that similar anomalies (though different in detail)
        exist in Perl, no doubt for the same reasons. The use of
        (*MARK) data after a failed match of an unanchored pattern
        is not recommended, unless (*COMMIT) is involved.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="refsect2" title="Verbs that act after backtracking">
        <a id="pcrepattern-3_sect47" name="pcrepattern-3_sect47" shape="rect"> </a>

        <h3>Verbs that act after backtracking</h3>

        <p>The following verbs do nothing when they are
        encountered. Matching continues with what follows, but if
        there is no subsequent match, causing a backtrack to the
        verb, a failure is forced. That is, backtracking cannot
        pass to the left of the verb. However, when one of these
        verbs appears inside an atomic group, its effect is
        confined to that group, because once the group has been
        matched, there is never any backtracking into it. In this
        situation, backtracking can "jump back" to the left of the
        entire atomic group. (Remember also, as stated above, that
        this localization also applies in subroutine calls and
        assertions.)</p>

        <p>These verbs differ in exactly what kind of failure
        occurs when backtracking reaches them.</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(*COMMIT)
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>This verb, which may not be followed by a name, causes
        the whole match to fail outright if the rest of the pattern
        does not match. Even if the pattern is unanchored, no
        further attempts to find a match by advancing the starting
        point take place. Once (*COMMIT) has been passed,
        <code class="function">pcre_exec</code>() is committed to
        finding a match at the current starting point, or not at
        all. For example:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
a+(*COMMIT)b
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>This matches "xxaab" but not "aacaab". It can be thought
        of as a kind of dynamic anchor, or "I've started, so I must
        finish." The name of the most recently passed (*MARK) in
        the path is passed back when (*COMMIT) forces a match
        failure.</p>

        <p>Note that (*COMMIT) at the start of a pattern is not the
        same as an anchor, unless PCRE's start-of-match
        optimizations are turned off, as shown in this <span class="command"><strong>pcretest</strong></span> example:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 /(*COMMIT)abc/
 xyzabc
  0: abc
 xyzabc\Y
 No match
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>PCRE knows that any match must start with "a", so the
        optimization skips along the subject to "a" before running
        the first match attempt, which succeeds. When the
        optimization is disabled by the \Y escape in the second
        subject, the match starts at "x" and so the (*COMMIT)
        causes it to fail without trying any other starting
        points.</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(*PRUNE) or (*PRUNE:NAME)
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>This verb causes the match to fail at the current
        starting position in the subject if the rest of the pattern
        does not match. If the pattern is unanchored, the normal
        "bumpalong" advance to the next starting character then
        happens. Backtracking can occur as usual to the left of
        (*PRUNE), before it is reached, or when matching to the
        right of (*PRUNE), but if there is no match to the right,
        backtracking cannot cross (*PRUNE). In simple cases, the
        use of (*PRUNE) is just an alternative to an atomic group
        or possessive quantifier, but there are some uses of
        (*PRUNE) that cannot be expressed in any other way. The
        behaviour of (*PRUNE:NAME) is the same as
        (*MARK:NAME)(*PRUNE) when the match fails completely; the
        name is passed back if this is the final attempt.
        (*PRUNE:NAME) does not pass back a name if the match
        succeeds. In an anchored pattern (*PRUNE) has the same
        effect as (*COMMIT).</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(*SKIP)
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>This verb, when given without a name, is like (*PRUNE),
        except that if the pattern is unanchored, the "bumpalong"
        advance is not to the next character, but to the position
        in the subject where (*SKIP) was encountered. (*SKIP)
        signifies that whatever text was matched leading up to it
        cannot be part of a successful match. Consider:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
a+(*SKIP)b
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>If the subject is "aaaac...", after the first match
        attempt fails (starting at the first character in the
        string), the starting point skips on to start the next
        attempt at "c". Note that a possessive quantifer does not
        have the same effect as this example; although it would
        suppress backtracking during the first match attempt, the
        second attempt would start at the second character instead
        of skipping on to "c".</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(*SKIP:NAME)
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>When (*SKIP) has an associated name, its behaviour is
        modified. If the following pattern fails to match, the
        previous path through the pattern is searched for the most
        recent (*MARK) that has the same name. If one is found, the
        "bumpalong" advance is to the subject position that
        corresponds to that (*MARK) instead of to where (*SKIP) was
        encountered. If no (*MARK) with a matching name is found,
        normal "bumpalong" of one character happens (the (*SKIP) is
        ignored).</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(*THEN) or (*THEN:NAME)
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>This verb causes a skip to the next alternation in the
        innermost enclosing group if the rest of the pattern does
        not match. That is, it cancels pending backtracking, but
        only within the current alternation. Its name comes from
        the observation that it can be used for a pattern-based
        if-then-else block:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
( COND1 (*THEN) FOO | COND2 (*THEN) BAR | COND3 (*THEN) BAZ ) ...
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>If the COND1 pattern matches, FOO is tried (and possibly
        further items after the end of the group if FOO succeeds);
        on failure the matcher skips to the second alternative and
        tries COND2, without backtracking into COND1. The behaviour
        of (*THEN:NAME) is exactly the same as (*MARK:NAME)(*THEN)
        if the overall match fails. If (*THEN) is not directly
        inside an alternation, it acts like (*PRUNE).</p>

        <p>The above verbs provide four different "strengths" of
        control when subsequent matching fails. (*THEN) is the
        weakest, carrying on the match at the next alternation.
        (*PRUNE) comes next, failing the match at the current
        starting position, but allowing an advance to the next
        character (for an unanchored pattern). (*SKIP) is similar,
        except that the advance may be more than one character.
        (*COMMIT) is the strongest, causing the entire match to
        fail.</p>

        <p>If more than one is present in a pattern, the "stongest"
        one wins. For example, consider this pattern, where A, B,
        etc. are complex pattern fragments:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(A(*COMMIT)B(*THEN)C|D)
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>Once A has matched, PCRE is committed to this match, at
        the current starting position. If subsequently B matches,
        but C does not, the normal (*THEN) action of trying the
        next alternation (that is, D) does not happen because
        (*COMMIT) overrides.</p>
