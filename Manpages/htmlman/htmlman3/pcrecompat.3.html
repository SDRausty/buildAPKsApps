      <h2>DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PCRE AND PERL</h2>

      <p>This document describes the differences in the ways that
      PCRE and Perl handle regular expressions. The differences
      described here are with respect to Perl versions 5.10 and
      above.</p>

      <p>1. PCRE has only a subset of Perl's UTF-8 and Unicode
      support. Details of what it does have are given in the
      section on UTF-8 support in the main <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcre.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcre</span>(3)</span></a> page.</p>

      <p>2. PCRE does not allow repeat quantifiers on lookahead
      assertions. Perl permits them, but they do not mean what you
      might think. For example, (?!a){3} does not assert that the
      next three characters are not "a". It just asserts that the
      next character is not "a" three times.</p>

      <p>3. Capturing subpatterns that occur inside negative
      lookahead assertions are counted, but their entries in the
      offsets vector are never set. Perl sets its numerical
      variables from any such patterns that are matched before the
      assertion fails to match something (thereby succeeding), but
      only if the negative lookahead assertion contains just one
      branch.</p>

      <p>4. Though binary zero characters are supported in the
      subject string, they are not allowed in a pattern string
      because it is passed as a normal C string, terminated by
      zero. The escape sequence \0 can be used in the pattern to
      represent a binary zero.</p>

      <p>5. The following Perl escape sequences are not supported:
      \l, \u, \L, \U, and \N. In fact these are implemented by
      Perl's general string-handling and are not part of its
      pattern matching engine. If any of these are encountered by
      PCRE, an error is generated.</p>

      <p>6. The Perl escape sequences \p, \P, and \X are supported
      only if PCRE is built with Unicode character property
      support. The properties that can be tested with \p and \P are
      limited to the general category properties such as Lu and Nd,
      script names such as Greek or Han, and the derived properties
      Any and L&amp;. PCRE does support the Cs (surrogate)
      property, which Perl does not; the Perl documentation says
      "Because Perl hides the need for the user to understand the
      internal representation of Unicode characters, there is no
      need to implement the somewhat messy concept of
      surrogates."</p>

      <p>7. PCRE does support the \Q...\E escape for quoting
      substrings. Characters in between are treated as literals.
      This is slightly different from Perl in that $ and @ are also
      handled as literals inside the quotes. In Perl, they cause
      variable interpolation (but of course PCRE does not have
      variables). Note the following examples:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
Pattern            PCRE matches      Perl matches
</pre>
      </div>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
   \Qabc$xyz\E        abc$xyz           abc followed by the
                                          contents of $xyz
   \Qabc\$xyz\E       abc\$xyz          abc\$xyz
   \Qabc\E\$\Qxyz\E   abc$xyz           abc$xyz
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>The \Q...\E sequence is recognized both inside and outside
      character classes.</p>

      <p>8. Fairly obviously, PCRE does not support the (?{code})
      and (??{code}) constructions. However, there is support for
      recursive patterns. This is not available in Perl 5.8, but it
      is in Perl 5.10. Also, the PCRE "callout" feature allows an
      external function to be called during pattern matching. See
      the <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcrecallout.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcrecallout</span>(3)</span></a>
      documentation for details.</p>

      <p>9. Subpatterns that are called recursively or as
      "subroutines" are always treated as atomic groups in PCRE.
      This is like Python, but unlike Perl. There is a discussion
      of an example that explains this in more detail in the
      section on recursion differences from Perl in the <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcrepattern.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcrepattern</span>(3)</span></a> page.</p>

      <p>10. There are some differences that are concerned with the
      settings of captured strings when part of a pattern is
      repeated. For example, matching "aba" against the pattern
      /^(a(b)?)+$/ in Perl leaves $2 unset, but in PCRE it is set
      to "b".</p>

      <p>11. PCRE's handling of duplicate subpattern numbers and
      duplicate subpattern names is not as general as Perl's. This
      is a consequence of the fact the PCRE works internally just
      with numbers, using an external table to translate between
      numbers and names. In particular, a pattern such as
      (?|(?&lt;a&gt;A)|(?&lt;b)B), where the two capturing
      parentheses have the same number but different names, is not
      supported, and causes an error at compile time. If it were
      allowed, it would not be possible to distinguish which
      parentheses matched, because both names map to capturing
      subpattern number 1. To avoid this confusing situation, an
      error is given at compile time.</p>

      <p>12. Perl recognizes comments in some places that PCRE
      doesn't, for example, between the ( and ? at the start of a
      subpattern.</p>

      <p>13. PCRE provides some extensions to the Perl regular
      expression facilities. Perl 5.10 includes new features that
      are not in earlier versions of Perl, some of which (such as
      named parentheses) have been in PCRE for some time. This list
      is with respect to Perl 5.10:</p>

      <p>(a) Although lookbehind assertions in PCRE must match
      fixed length strings, each alternative branch of a lookbehind
      assertion can match a different length of string. Perl
      requires them all to have the same length.</p>

      <p>(b) If PCRE_DOLLAR_ENDONLY is set and PCRE_MULTILINE is
      not set, the $ meta-character matches only at the very end of
      the string.</p>

      <p>(c) If PCRE_EXTRA is set, a backslash followed by a letter
      with no special meaning is faulted. Otherwise, like Perl, the
      backslash is quietly ignored. (Perl can be made to issue a
      warning.)</p>

      <p>(d) If PCRE_UNGREEDY is set, the greediness of the
      repetition quantifiers is inverted, that is, by default they
      are not greedy, but if followed by a question mark they
      are.</p>

      <p>(e) PCRE_ANCHORED can be used at matching time to force a
      pattern to be tried only at the first matching position in
      the subject string.</p>

      <p>(f) The PCRE_NOTBOL, PCRE_NOTEOL, PCRE_NOTEMPTY,
      PCRE_NOTEMPTY_ATSTART, and PCRE_NO_AUTO_CAPTURE options for
      <code class="function">pcre_exec</code>() have no Perl
      equivalents.</p>

      <p>(g) The \R escape sequence can be restricted to match only
      CR, LF, or CRLF by the PCRE_BSR_ANYCRLF option.</p>

      <p>(h) The callout facility is PCRE-specific.</p>

      <p>(i) The partial matching facility is PCRE-specific.</p>

      <p>(j) Patterns compiled by PCRE can be saved and re-used at
      a later time, even on different hosts that have the other
      endianness.</p>

      <p>(k) The alternative matching function (<code class="function">pcre_dfa_exec</code>()) matches in a different way
      and is not Perl-compatible.</p>

      <p>(l) PCRE recognizes some special sequences such as (*CR)
      at the start of a pattern that set overall options that
      cannot be changed within the pattern.</p>
