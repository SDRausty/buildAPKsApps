      <h2>SAVING AND RE-USING PRECOMPILED PCRE PATTERNS</h2>

      <p>If you are running an application that uses a large number
      of regular expression patterns, it may be useful to store
      them in a precompiled form instead of having to compile them
      every time the application is run. If you are not using any
      private character tables (see the <span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcre_maketables()</span>(3)</span>
      documentation), this is relatively straightforward. If you
      are using private tables, it is a little bit more
      complicated.</p>

      <p>If you save compiled patterns to a file, you can copy them
      to a different host and run them there. This works even if
      the new host has the opposite endianness to the one on which
      the patterns were compiled. There may be a small performance
      penalty, but it should be insignificant. However, compiling
      regular expressions with one version of PCRE for use with a
      different version is not guaranteed to work and may cause
      crashes.</p>

    <div class="refsect1" title="SAVING A COMPILED PATTERN">
      <a id="pcreprecompile-3_sect2" name="pcreprecompile-3_sect2" shape="rect"> </a>

      <h2>SAVING A COMPILED PATTERN</h2>

      <p>The value returned by <code class="function">pcre_compile</code>() points to a single block of
      memory that holds the compiled pattern and associated data.
      You can find the length of this block in bytes by calling
      <code class="function">pcre_fullinfo</code>() with an
      argument of PCRE_INFO_SIZE. You can then save the data in any
      appropriate manner. Here is sample code that compiles a
      pattern and writes it to a file. It assumes that the variable
      <code class="varname">fd</code> refers to a file that is open
      for output:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 int erroroffset, rc, size;
 char *error;
 pcre *re;
</pre>
      </div>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 re = pcre_compile("my pattern", 0, &amp;error, &amp;erroroffset, NULL);
 if (re == NULL) { ... handle errors ... }
 rc = pcre_fullinfo(re, NULL, PCRE_INFO_SIZE, &amp;size);
 if (rc &lt; 0) { ... handle errors ... }
 rc = fwrite(re, 1, size, fd);
 if (rc != size) { ... handle errors ... }
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>In this example, the bytes that comprise the compiled
      pattern are copied exactly. Note that this is binary data
      that may contain any of the 256 possible byte values. On
      systems that make a distinction between binary and non-binary
      data, be sure that the file is opened for binary output.</p>

      <p>If you want to write more than one pattern to a file, you
      will have to devise a way of separating them. For binary
      data, preceding each pattern with its length is probably the
      most straightforward approach. Another possibility is to
      write out the data in hexadecimal instead of binary, one
      pattern to a line.</p>

      <p>Saving compiled patterns in a file is only one possible
      way of storing them for later use. They could equally well be
      saved in a database, or in the memory of some daemon process
      that passes them via sockets to the processes that want
      them.</p>

      <p>If the pattern has been studied, it is also possible to
      save the study data in a similar way to the compiled pattern
      itself. When studying generates additional information,
      <code class="function">pcre_study</code>() returns a pointer
      to a <code class="function">pcre_extra</code> data block. Its
      format is defined in the section on matching a pattern in the
      <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcreapi.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcreapi</span>(3)</span></a> documentation.
      The <code class="varname">study_data</code> field points to
      the binary study data, and this is what you must save (not
      the <code class="function">pcre_extra</code> block itself).
      The length of the study data can be obtained by calling
      <code class="function">pcre_fullinfo</code>() with an
      argument of PCRE_INFO_STUDYSIZE. Remember to check that
      <code class="function">pcre_study</code>() did return a
      non-NULL value before trying to save the study data.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="refsect1" title="RE-USING A PRECOMPILED PATTERN">
      <a id="pcreprecompile-3_sect3" name="pcreprecompile-3_sect3" shape="rect"> </a>

      <h2>RE-USING A PRECOMPILED PATTERN</h2>

      <p>Re-using a precompiled pattern is straightforward. Having
      reloaded it into main memory, you pass its pointer to
      <code class="function">pcre_exec</code>() or <code class="function">pcre_dfa_exec</code>() in the usual way. This
      should work even on another host, and even if that host has
      the opposite endianness to the one where the pattern was
      compiled.</p>

      <p>However, if you passed a pointer to custom character
      tables when the pattern was compiled (the <em class="parameter"><code>tableptr</code></em> argument of
      <code class="function">pcre_compile</code>()), you must now
      pass a similar pointer to <code class="function">pcre_exec</code>() or <code class="function">pcre_dfa_exec</code>(), because the value saved
      with the compiled pattern will obviously be nonsense. A field
      in a <code class="function">pcre_extra</code>() block is used
      to pass this data, as described in the section on matching a
      pattern in the <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcreapi.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcreapi</span>(3)</span></a>
      documentation.</p>

      <p>If you did not provide custom character tables when the
      pattern was compiled, the pointer in the compiled pattern is
      NULL, which causes <code class="function">pcre_exec</code>()
      to use PCRE's internal tables. Thus, you do not need to take
      any special action at run time in this case.</p>

      <p>If you saved study data with the compiled pattern, you
      need to create your own <code class="function">pcre_extra</code> data block and set the
      <code class="varname">study_data</code> field to point to the
      reloaded study data. You must also set the
      PCRE_EXTRA_STUDY_DATA bit in the <code class="varname">flags</code> field to indicate that study data is
      present. Then pass the <code class="function">pcre_extra</code> block to <code class="function">pcre_exec</code>() or <code class="function">pcre_dfa_exec</code>() in the usual way.</p>

      <h2>COMPATIBILITY WITH DIFFERENT PCRE RELEASES</h2>

      <p>In general, it is safest to recompile all saved patterns
      when you update to a new PCRE release, though not all updates
      actually require this.</p>
