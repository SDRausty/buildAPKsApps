      <h2>PARTIAL MATCHING IN PCRE</h2>

      <p>In normal use of PCRE, if the subject string that is
      passed to <code class="function">pcre_exec</code>() or
      <code class="function">pcre_dfa_exec</code>() matches as far
      as it goes, but is too short to match the entire pattern,
      PCRE_ERROR_NOMATCH is returned. There are circumstances where
      it might be helpful to distinguish this case from other cases
      in which there is no match.</p>

      <p>Consider, for example, an application where a human is
      required to type in data for a field with specific formatting
      requirements. An example might be a date in the form
      <em class="replaceable"><code>ddmmmyy</code></em>, defined by
      this pattern:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
^\d?\d(jan|feb|mar|apr|may|jun|jul|aug|sep|oct|nov|dec)\d\d$
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>If the application sees the user's keystrokes one by one,
      and can check that what has been typed so far is potentially
      valid, it is able to raise an error as soon as a mistake is
      made, by beeping and not reflecting the character that has
      been typed, for example. This immediate feedback is likely to
      be a better user interface than a check that is delayed until
      the entire string has been entered. Partial matching can also
      be useful when the subject string is very long and is not all
      available at once.</p>

      <p>PCRE supports partial matching by means of the
      PCRE_PARTIAL_SOFT and PCRE_PARTIAL_HARD options, which can be
      set when calling <code class="function">pcre_exec</code>() or
      <code class="function">pcre_dfa_exec</code>(). For backwards
      compatibility, PCRE_PARTIAL is a synonym for
      PCRE_PARTIAL_SOFT. The essential difference between the two
      options is whether or not a partial match is preferred to an
      alternative complete match, though the details differ between
      the two matching functions. If both options are set,
      PCRE_PARTIAL_HARD takes precedence.</p>

      <p>Setting a partial matching option disables two of PCRE's
      optimizations. PCRE remembers the last literal byte in a
      pattern, and abandons matching immediately if such a byte is
      not present in the subject string. This optimization cannot
      be used for a subject string that might match only partially.
      If the pattern was studied, PCRE knows the minimum length of
      a matching string, and does not bother to run the matching
      function on shorter strings. This optimization is also
      disabled for partial matching.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="refsect1" title="PARTIAL MATCHING USING pcre_exec()">
      <a id="pcrepartial-3_sect2" name="pcrepartial-3_sect2" shape="rect"> </a>

      <h2>PARTIAL MATCHING USING pcre_exec()</h2>

      <p>A partial match occurs during a call to <code class="function">pcre_exec</code>() when the end of the subject
      string is reached successfully, but matching cannot continue
      because more characters are needed. However, at least one
      character in the subject must have been inspected. This
      character need not form part of the final matched string;
      lookbehind assertions and the \K escape sequence provide ways
      of inspecting characters before the start of a matched
      substring. The requirement for inspecting at least one
      character exists because an empty string can always be
      matched; without such a restriction there would always be a
      partial match of an empty string at the end of the
      subject.</p>

      <p>If there are at least two slots in the offsets vector when
      <code class="function">pcre_exec</code>() returns with a
      partial match, the first slot is set to the offset of the
      earliest character that was inspected when the partial match
      was found. For convenience, the second offset points to the
      end of the subject so that a substring can easily be
      identified.</p>

      <p>For the majority of patterns, the first offset identifies
      the start of the partially matched string. However, for
      patterns that contain lookbehind assertions, or \K, or begin
      with \b or \B, earlier characters have been inspected while
      carrying out the match. For example:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
/(?&lt;=abc)123/
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>This pattern matches "123", but only if it is preceded by
      "abc". If the subject string is "xyzabc12", the offsets after
      a partial match are for the substring "abc12", because all
      these characters are needed if another match is tried with
      extra characters added to the subject.</p>

      <p>What happens when a partial match is identified depends on
      which of the two partial matching options are set.</p>

      <div class="refsect2" title="PCRE_PARTIAL_SOFT with pcre_exec()">
        <a id="pcrepartial-3_sect3" name="pcrepartial-3_sect3" shape="rect"> </a>

        <h3>PCRE_PARTIAL_SOFT with pcre_exec()</h3>

        <p>If PCRE_PARTIAL_SOFT is set when <code class="function">pcre_exec</code>() identifies a partial match,
        the partial match is remembered, but matching continues as
        normal, and other alternatives in the pattern are tried. If
        no complete match can be found, <code class="function">pcre_exec</code>() returns PCRE_ERROR_PARTIAL
        instead of PCRE_ERROR_NOMATCH.</p>

        <p>This option is "soft" because it prefers a complete
        match over a partial match. All the various matching items
        in a pattern behave as if the subject string is potentially
        complete. For example, \z, \Z, and $ match at the end of
        the subject, as normal, and for \b and \B the end of the
        subject is treated as a non-alphanumeric.</p>

        <p>If there is more than one partial match, the first one
        that was found provides the data that is returned. Consider
        this pattern:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
/123\w+X|dogY/
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>If this is matched against the subject string
        "abc123dog", both alternatives fail to match, but the end
        of the subject is reached during matching, so
        PCRE_ERROR_PARTIAL is returned. The offsets are set to 3
        and 9, identifying "123dog" as the first partial match that
        was found. (In this example, there are two partial matches,
        because "dog" on its own partially matches the second
        alternative.)</p>
      </div>

      <div class="refsect2" title="PCRE_PARTIAL_HARD with pcre_exec()">
        <a id="pcrepartial-3_sect4" name="pcrepartial-3_sect4" shape="rect"> </a>

        <h3>PCRE_PARTIAL_HARD with pcre_exec()</h3>

        <p>If PCRE_PARTIAL_HARD is set for <code class="function">pcre_exec</code>(), it returns
        PCRE_ERROR_PARTIAL as soon as a partial match is found,
        without continuing to search for possible complete matches.
        This option is "hard" because it prefers an earlier partial
        match over a later complete match. For this reason, the
        assumption is made that the end of the supplied subject
        string may not be the true end of the available data, and
        so, if \z, \Z, \b, \B, or $ are encountered at the end of
        the subject, the result is PCRE_ERROR_PARTIAL.</p>

        <p>Setting PCRE_PARTIAL_HARD also affects the way
        <code class="function">pcre_exec</code>() checks UTF-8
        subject strings for validity. Normally, an invalid UTF-8
        sequence causes the error PCRE_ERROR_BADUTF8. However, in
        the special case of a truncated UTF-8 character at the end
        of the subject, PCRE_ERROR_SHORTUTF8 is returned when
        PCRE_PARTIAL_HARD is set.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="refsect2" title="Comparing hard and soft partial matching">
        <a id="pcrepartial-3_sect5" name="pcrepartial-3_sect5" shape="rect"> </a>

        <h3>Comparing hard and soft partial matching</h3>

        <p>The difference between the two partial matching options
        can be illustrated by a pattern such as:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
/dog(sbody)?/
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>This matches either "dog" or "dogsbody", greedily (that
        is, it prefers the longer string if possible). If it is
        matched against the string "dog" with PCRE_PARTIAL_SOFT, it
        yields a complete match for "dog". However, if
        PCRE_PARTIAL_HARD is set, the result is PCRE_ERROR_PARTIAL.
        On the other hand, if the pattern is made ungreedy the
        result is different:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
/dog(sbody)??/
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>In this case the result is always a complete match
        because <code class="function">pcre_exec</code>() finds
        that first, and it never continues after finding a match.
        It might be easier to follow this explanation by thinking
        of the two patterns like this:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 /dog(sbody)?/    is the same as  /dogsbody|dog/
 /dog(sbody)??/   is the same as  /dog|dogsbody/
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>The second pattern will never match "dogsbody" when
        <code class="function">pcre_exec</code>() is used, because
        it will always find the shorter match first.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="refsect1" title="PARTIAL MATCHING USING pcre_dfa_exec()">
      <a id="pcrepartial-3_sect6" name="pcrepartial-3_sect6" shape="rect"> </a>

      <h2>PARTIAL MATCHING USING pcre_dfa_exec()</h2>

      <p>The <code class="function">pcre_dfa_exec</code>() function
      moves along the subject string character by character,
      without backtracking, searching for all possible matches
      simultaneously. If the end of the subject is reached before
      the end of the pattern, there is the possibility of a partial
      match, again provided that at least one character has been
      inspected.</p>

      <p>When PCRE_PARTIAL_SOFT is set, PCRE_ERROR_PARTIAL is
      returned only if there have been no complete matches.
      Otherwise, the complete matches are returned. However, if
      PCRE_PARTIAL_HARD is set, a partial match takes precedence
      over any complete matches. The portion of the string that was
      inspected when the longest partial match was found is set as
      the first matching string, provided there are at least two
      slots in the offsets vector.</p>

      <p>Because <code class="function">pcre_dfa_exec</code>()
      always searches for all possible matches, and there is no
      difference between greedy and ungreedy repetition, its
      behaviour is different from <code class="function">pcre_exec</code> when PCRE_PARTIAL_HARD is set.
      Consider the string "dog" matched against the ungreedy
      pattern shown above:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
/dog(sbody)??/
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>Whereas <code class="function">pcre_exec</code>() stops as
      soon as it finds the complete match for "dog", <code class="function">pcre_dfa_exec</code>() also finds the partial
      match for "dogsbody", and so returns that when
      PCRE_PARTIAL_HARD is set.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="refsect1" title="PARTIAL MATCHING AND WORD BOUNDARIES">
      <a id="pcrepartial-3_sect7" name="pcrepartial-3_sect7" shape="rect"> </a>

      <h2>PARTIAL MATCHING AND WORD BOUNDARIES</h2>

      <p>If a pattern ends with one of sequences \b or \B, which
      test for word boundaries, partial matching with
      PCRE_PARTIAL_SOFT can give counter-intuitive results.
      Consider this pattern:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
/\bcat\b/
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>This matches "cat", provided there is a word boundary at
      either end. If the subject string is "the cat", the
      comparison of the final "t" with a following character cannot
      take place, so a partial match is found. However,
      <code class="function">pcre_exec</code>() carries on with
      normal matching, which matches \b at the end of the subject
      when the last character is a letter, thus finding a complete
      match. The result, therefore, is <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> PCRE_ERROR_PARTIAL. The same
      thing happens with <code class="function">pcre_dfa_exec</code>(), because it also finds the
      complete match.</p>

      <p>Using PCRE_PARTIAL_HARD in this case does yield
      PCRE_ERROR_PARTIAL, because then the partial match takes
      precedence.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="refsect1" title="FORMERLY RESTRICTED PATTERNS">
      <a id="pcrepartial-3_sect8" name="pcrepartial-3_sect8" shape="rect"> </a>

      <h2>FORMERLY RESTRICTED PATTERNS</h2>

      <p>For releases of PCRE prior to 8.00, because of the way
      certain internal optimizations were implemented in the
      <code class="function">pcre_exec</code>() function, the
      PCRE_PARTIAL option (predecessor of PCRE_PARTIAL_SOFT) could
      not be used with all patterns. From release 8.00 onwards, the
      restrictions no longer apply, and partial matching with
      <code class="function">pcre_exec</code>() can be requested
      for any pattern.</p>

      <p>Items that were formerly restricted were repeated single
      characters and repeated metasequences. If PCRE_PARTIAL was
      set for a pattern that did not conform to the restrictions,
      <code class="function">pcre_exec</code>() returned the error
      code PCRE_ERROR_BADPARTIAL (-13). This error code is no
      longer in use. The PCRE_INFO_OKPARTIAL call to <code class="function">pcre_fullinfo</code>() to find out if a compiled
      pattern can be used for partial matching now always returns
      1.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="refsect1" title="EXAMPLE OF PARTIAL MATCHING USING PCRETEST">
      <a id="pcrepartial-3_sect9" name="pcrepartial-3_sect9" shape="rect"> </a>

      <h2>EXAMPLE OF PARTIAL MATCHING USING PCRETEST</h2>

      <p>If the escape sequence \P is present in a <span class="command"><strong>pcretest</strong></span> data line, the
      PCRE_PARTIAL_SOFT option is used for the match. Here is a run
      of <span class="command"><strong>pcretest</strong></span>
      that uses the date example quoted above:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
   re&gt; /^\d?\d(jan|feb|mar|apr|may|jun|jul|aug|sep|oct|nov|dec)\d\d$/
 data&gt; 25jun04\P
  0: 25jun04
  1: jun
 data&gt; 25dec3\P
 Partial match: 23dec3
 data&gt; 3ju\P
 Partial match: 3ju
 data&gt; 3juj\P
 No match
 data&gt; j\P
 No match
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>The first data string is matched completely, so
      <span class="command"><strong>pcretest</strong></span> shows
      the matched substrings. The remaining four strings do not
      match the complete pattern, but the first two are partial
      matches. Similar output is obtained when <code class="function">pcre_dfa_exec</code>() is used.</p>

      <p>If the escape sequence \P is present more than once in a
      <span class="command"><strong>pcretest</strong></span> data
      line, the PCRE_PARTIAL_HARD option is set for the match.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="refsect1" title="MULTI-SEGMENT MATCHING WITH pcre_dfa_exec()">
      <a id="pcrepartial-3_sect10" name="pcrepartial-3_sect10" shape="rect"> </a>

      <h2>MULTI-SEGMENT MATCHING WITH pcre_dfa_exec()</h2>

      <p>When a partial match has been found using <code class="function">pcre_dfa_exec</code>(), it is possible to continue
      the match by providing additional subject data and calling
      <code class="function">pcre_dfa_exec</code>() again with the
      same compiled regular expression, this time setting the
      PCRE_DFA_RESTART option. You must pass the same working space
      as before, because this is where details of the previous
      partial match are stored. Here is an example using
      <span class="command"><strong>pcretest</strong></span>, using
      the \R escape sequence to set the PCRE_DFA_RESTART option (\D
      specifies the use of <code class="function">pcre_dfa_exec</code>()):</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
   re&gt; /^\d?\d(jan|feb|mar|apr|may|jun|jul|aug|sep|oct|nov|dec)\d\d$/
 data&gt; 23ja\P\D
 Partial match: 23ja
 data&gt; n05\R\D
  0: n05
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>The first call has "23ja" as the subject, and requests
      partial matching; the second call has "n05" as the subject
      for the continued (restarted) match. Notice that when the
      match is complete, only the last part is shown; PCRE does not
      retain the previously partially-matched string. It is up to
      the calling program to do that if it needs to.</p>

      <p>You can set the PCRE_PARTIAL_SOFT or PCRE_PARTIAL_HARD
      options with PCRE_DFA_RESTART to continue partial matching
      over multiple segments. This facility can be used to pass
      very long subject strings to <code class="function">pcre_dfa_exec</code>().</p>
    </div>

      <h2>MULTI-SEGMENT MATCHING WITH pcre_exec()</h2>

      <p>From release 8.00, <code class="function">pcre_exec</code>() can also be used to do
      multi-segment matching. Unlike <code class="function">pcre_dfa_exec</code>(), it is not possible to
      restart the previous match with a new segment of data.
      Instead, new data must be added to the previous subject
      string, and the entire match re-run, starting from the point
      where the partial match occurred. Earlier data can be
      discarded. It is best to use PCRE_PARTIAL_HARD in this
      situation, because it does not treat the end of a segment as
      the end of the subject when matching \z, \Z, \b, \B, and $.
      Consider an unanchored pattern that matches dates:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
   re&gt; /\d?\d(jan|feb|mar|apr|may|jun|jul|aug|sep|oct|nov|dec)\d\d/
 data&gt; The date is 23ja\P\P
 Partial match: 23ja
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>At this stage, an application could discard the text
      preceding "23ja", add on text from the next segment, and call
      <code class="function">pcre_exec</code>() again. Unlike
      <code class="function">pcre_dfa_exec</code>(), the entire
      matching string must always be available, and the complete
      matching process occurs for each call, so more memory and
      more processing time is needed.</p>

      <h2>ISSUES WITH MULTI-SEGMENT MATCHING</h2>

      <p>Certain types of pattern may give problems with
      multi-segment matching, whichever matching function is
      used.</p>

      <p>1. If the pattern contains a test for the beginning of a
      line, you need to pass the PCRE_NOTBOL option when the
      subject string for any call does start at the beginning of a
      line. There is also a PCRE_NOTEOL option, but in practice
      when doing multi-segment matching you should be using
      PCRE_PARTIAL_HARD, which includes the effect of
      PCRE_NOTEOL.</p>

      <p>2. Lookbehind assertions at the start of a pattern are
      catered for in the offsets that are returned for a partial
      match. However, in theory, a lookbehind assertion later in
      the pattern could require even earlier characters to be
      inspected, and it might not have been reached when a partial
      match occurs. This is probably an extremely unlikely case;
      you could guard against it to a certain extent by always
      including extra characters at the start.</p>

      <p>3. Matching a subject string that is split into multiple
      segments may not always produce exactly the same result as
      matching over one single long string, especially when
      PCRE_PARTIAL_SOFT is used. The section "Partial Matching and
      Word Boundaries" above describes an issue that arises if the
      pattern ends with \b or \B. Another kind of difference may
      occur when there are multiple matching possibilities, because
      (for PCRE_PARTIAL_SOFT) a partial match result is given only
      when there are no completed matches. This means that as soon
      as the shortest match has been found, continuation to a new
      subject segment is no longer possible. Consider again this
      <span class="command"><strong>pcretest</strong></span>
      example:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
   re&gt; /dog(sbody)?/
 data&gt; dogsb\P
  0: dog
 data&gt; do\P\D
 Partial match: do
 data&gt; gsb\R\P\D
  0: g
 data&gt; dogsbody\D
  0: dogsbody
  1: dog
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>The first data line passes the string "dogsb" to
      <code class="function">pcre_exec</code>(), setting the
      PCRE_PARTIAL_SOFT option. Although the string is a partial
      match for "dogsbody", the result is not PCRE_ERROR_PARTIAL,
      because the shorter string "dog" is a complete match.
      Similarly, when the subject is presented to <code class="function">pcre_dfa_exec</code>() in several parts ("do" and
      "gsb" being the first two) the match stops when "dog" has
      been found, and it is not possible to continue. On the other
      hand, if "dogsbody" is presented as a single string,
      <code class="function">pcre_dfa_exec</code>() finds both
      matches.</p>

      <p>Because of these problems, it is best to use
      PCRE_PARTIAL_HARD when matching multi-segment data. The
      example above then behaves differently:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
   re&gt; /dog(sbody)?/
 data&gt; dogsb\P\P
 Partial match: dogsb
 data&gt; do\P\D
 Partial match: do
 data&gt; gsb\R\P\P\D
 Partial match: gsb
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>4. Patterns that contain alternatives at the top level
      which do not all start with the same pattern item may not
      work as expected when PCRE_DFA_RESTART is used with
      <code class="function">pcre_dfa_exec</code>(). For example,
      consider this pattern:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
1234|3789
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>If the first part of the subject is "ABC123", a partial
      match of the first alternative is found at offset 3. There is
      no partial match for the second alternative, because such a
      match does not start at the same point in the subject string.
      Attempting to continue with the string "7890" does not yield
      a match because only those alternatives that match at one
      point in the subject are remembered. The problem arises
      because the start of the second alternative matches within
      the first alternative. There is no problem with anchored
      patterns or patterns such as:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
1234|ABCD
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>where no string can be a partial match for both
      alternatives. This is not a problem if <code class="function">pcre_exec</code>() is used, because the entire
      match has to be rerun each time:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
   re&gt; /1234|3789/
 data&gt; ABC123\P\P
 Partial match: 123
 data&gt; 1237890
  0: 3789
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>Of course, instead of using PCRE_DFA_RESTART, the same
      technique of re-running the entire match can also be used
      with <code class="function">pcre_dfa_exec</code>(). Another
      possibility is to work with two buffers. If a partial match
      at offset <code class="literal">n</code> in the first buffer
      is followed by "no match" when PCRE_DFA_RESTART is used on
      the second buffer, you can then try a new match starting at
      offset <em class="replaceable"><code>n+1</code></em> in the
      first buffer.</p>
