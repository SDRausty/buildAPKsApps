      <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

      <p>Linux is an international operating system. Various of its
      utilities and device drivers (including the console driver)
      support multilingual character sets including Latin-alphabet
      letters with diacritical marks, accents, ligatures, and
      entire non-Latin alphabets including Greek, Cyrillic, Arabic,
      and Hebrew.</p>

      <p>This manual page presents a programmer's-eye view of
      different character-set standards and how they fit together
      on Linux. Standards discussed include ASCII, ISO 8859,
      KOI8-R, Unicode, ISO 2022 and ISO 4873. The primary emphasis
      is on character sets actually used as locale character sets,
      not the myriad others that can be found in data from other
      systems.</p>

      <p>A complete list of charsets used in an officially
      supported locale in glibc 2.2.3 is:
      ISO-8859-{1,2,3,5,6,7,8,9,13,15}, CP1251, UTF-8,
      EUC-{KR,JP,TW}, KOI8-{R,U}, GB2312, GB18030, GBK, BIG5,
      BIG5-HKSCS and TIS-620 (in no particular order.) (Romanian
      may be switching to ISO-8859-16.)</p>

        <h3>ASCII</h3>

        <p>ASCII (American Standard Code For Information
        Interchange) is the original 7-bit character set,
        originally designed for American English. It is currently
        described by the ECMA-6 standard.</p>

        <p>Various ASCII variants replacing the dollar sign with
        other currency symbols and replacing punctuation with
        non-English alphabetic characters to cover German, French,
        Spanish and others in 7 bits exist. All are deprecated;
        glibc doesn't support locales whose character sets aren't
        true supersets of ASCII. (These sets are also known as
        ISO-646, a close relative of ASCII that permitted replacing
        these characters.)</p>

        <p>As Linux was written for hardware designed in the US, it
        natively supports ASCII.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="refsect2" title="ISO 8859">
        <a id="charsets-7_sect3" name="charsets-7_sect3" shape="rect"> </a>

        <h3>ISO 8859</h3>

        <p>ISO 8859 is a series of 15 8-bit character sets all of
        which have US ASCII in their low (7-bit) half, invisible
        control characters in positions 128 to 159, and 96
        fixed-width graphics in positions 160-255.</p>

        <p>Of these, the most important is ISO 8859-1 (Latin-1). It
        is natively supported in the Linux console driver, fairly
        well supported in X11R6, and is the base character set of
        HTML.</p>

        <p>Console support for the other 8859 character sets is
        available under Linux through user-mode utilities (such as
        <span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">setfont</span>(8)</span>) that modify
        keyboard bindings and the EGA graphics table and employ the
        "user mapping" font table in the console driver.</p>

        <p>Here are brief descriptions of each set:</p>

        <div class="variablelist">
          <dl>
            <dt><span class="term">8859-1 (Latin-1)</span></dt>

            <dd>
              <p>Latin-1 covers most Western European languages
              such as Albanian, Catalan, Danish, Dutch, English,
              Faroese, Finnish, French, German, Galician, Irish,
              Icelandic, Italian, Norwegian, Portuguese, Spanish,
              and Swedish. The lack of the ligatures Dutch ij,
              French oe and old-style ,,German`` quotation marks is
              considered tolerable.</p>
            </dd>

            <dt><span class="term">8859-2 (Latin-2)</span></dt>

            <dd>
              <p>Latin-2 supports most Latin-written Slavic and
              Central European languages: Croatian, Czech, German,
              Hungarian, Polish, Rumanian, Slovak, and Slovene.</p>
            </dd>

            <dt><span class="term">8859-3 (Latin-3)</span></dt>

            <dd>
              <p>Latin-3 is popular with authors of Esperanto,
              Galician, and Maltese. (Turkish is now written with
              8859-9 instead.)</p>
            </dd>

            <dt><span class="term">8859-4 (Latin-4)</span></dt>

            <dd>
              <p>Latin-4 introduced letters for Estonian, Latvian,
              and Lithuanian. It is essentially obsolete; see
              8859-10 (Latin-6) and 8859-13 (Latin-7).</p>
            </dd>

            <dt><span class="term">8859-5</span></dt>

            <dd>
              <p>Cyrillic letters supporting Bulgarian,
              Byelorussian, Macedonian, Russian, Serbian and
              Ukrainian. Ukrainians read the letter "ghe" with
              downstroke as "heh" and would need a ghe with
              upstroke to write a correct ghe. See the discussion
              of KOI8-R below.</p>
            </dd>

            <dt><span class="term">8859-6</span></dt>

            <dd>
              <p>Supports Arabic. The 8859-6 glyph table is a fixed
              font of separate letter forms, but a proper display
              engine should combine these using the proper initial,
              medial, and final forms.</p>
            </dd>

            <dt><span class="term">8859-7</span></dt>

            <dd>
              <p>Supports Modern Greek.</p>
            </dd>

            <dt><span class="term">8859-8</span></dt>

            <dd>
              <p>Supports modern Hebrew without niqud (punctuation
              signs). Niqud and full-fledged Biblical Hebrew are
              outside the scope of this character set; under Linux,
              UTF-8 is the preferred encoding for these.</p>
            </dd>

            <dt><span class="term">8859-9 (Latin-5)</span></dt>

            <dd>
              <p>This is a variant of Latin-1 that replaces
              Icelandic letters with Turkish ones.</p>
            </dd>

            <dt><span class="term">8859-10 (Latin-6)</span></dt>

            <dd>
              <p>Latin 6 adds the last Inuit (Greenlandic) and Sami
              (Lappish) letters that were missing in Latin 4 to
              cover the entire Nordic area. RFC 1345 listed a
              preliminary and different "latin6". Skolt Sami still
              needs a few more accents than these.</p>
            </dd>

            <dt><span class="term">8859-11</span></dt>

            <dd>
              <p>This only exists as a rejected draft standard. The
              draft standard was identical to TIS-620, which is
              used under Linux for Thai.</p>
            </dd>

            <dt><span class="term">8859-12</span></dt>

            <dd>
              <p>This set does not exist. While Vietnamese has been
              suggested for this space, it does not fit within the
              96 (noncombining) characters ISO 8859 offers. UTF-8
              is the preferred character set for Vietnamese use
              under Linux.</p>
            </dd>

            <dt><span class="term">8859-13 (Latin-7)</span></dt>

            <dd>
              <p>Supports the Baltic Rim languages; in particular,
              it includes Latvian characters not found in
              Latin-4.</p>
            </dd>

            <dt><span class="term">8859-14 (Latin-8)</span></dt>

            <dd>
              <p>This is the Celtic character set, covering Gaelic
              and Welsh. This charset also contains the dotted
              characters needed for Old Irish.</p>
            </dd>

            <dt><span class="term">8859-15 (Latin-9)</span></dt>

            <dd>
              <p>This adds the Euro sign and French and Finnish
              letters that were missing in Latin-1.</p>
            </dd>

              <p>This set covers many of the languages covered by
              8859-2, and supports Romanian more completely then
              that set does.</p>

        <a id="charsets-7_sect4" name="charsets-7_sect4" shape="rect"> </a>

        <h3>KOI8-R</h3>

        <p>KOI8-R is a non-ISO character set popular in Russia. The
        lower half is US ASCII; the upper is a Cyrillic character
        set somewhat better designed than ISO 8859-5. KOI8-U is a
        common character set, based off KOI8-R, that has better
        support for Ukrainian. Neither of these sets are ISO-2022
        compatible, unlike the ISO-8859 series.</p>

        <p>Console support for KOI8-R is available under Linux
        through user-mode utilities that modify keyboard bindings
        and the EGA graphics table, and employ the "user mapping"
        font table in the console driver.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="refsect2" title="JIS X 0208">
        <a id="charsets-7_sect5" name="charsets-7_sect5" shape="rect"> </a>

        <h3>JIS X 0208</h3>

        <p>JIS X 0208 is a Japanese national standard character
        set. Though there are some more Japanese national standard
        character sets (like JIS X 0201, JIS X 0212, and JIS X
        0213), this is the most important one. Characters are
        mapped into a 94x94 two-byte matrix, whose each byte is in
        the range 0x21-0x7e. Note that JIS X 0208 is a character
        set, not an encoding. This means that JIS X 0208 itself is
        not used for expressing text data. JIS X 0208 is used as a
        component to construct encodings such as EUC-JP, Shift_JIS,
        and ISO-2022-JP. EUC-JP is the most important encoding for
        Linux and includes US ASCII and JIS X 0208. In EUC-JP, JIS
        X 0208 characters are expressed in two bytes, each of which
        is the JIS X 0208 code plus 0x80.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="refsect2" title="KS X 1001">
        <a id="charsets-7_sect6" name="charsets-7_sect6" shape="rect"> </a>

        <h3>KS X 1001</h3>

        <p>KS X 1001 is a Korean national standard character set.
        Just as JIS X 0208, characters are mapped into a 94x94
        two-byte matrix. KS X 1001 is used like JIS X 0208, as a
        component to construct encodings such as EUC-KR, Johab, and
        ISO-2022-KR. EUC-KR is the most important encoding for
        Linux and includes US ASCII and KS X 1001. KS C 5601 is an
        older name for KS X 1001.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="refsect2" title="GB 2312">
        <a id="charsets-7_sect7" name="charsets-7_sect7" shape="rect"> </a>

        <h3>GB 2312</h3>

        <p>GB 2312 is a mainland Chinese national standard
        character set used to express simplified Chinese. Just like
        JIS X 0208, characters are mapped into a 94x94 two-byte
        matrix used to construct EUC-CN. EUC-CN is the most
        important encoding for Linux and includes US ASCII and GB
        2312. Note that EUC-CN is often called as GB, GB 2312, or
        CN-GB.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="refsect2" title="Big5">
        <a id="charsets-7_sect8" name="charsets-7_sect8" shape="rect"> </a>

        <h3>Big5</h3>

        <p>Big5 is a popular character set in Taiwan to express
        traditional Chinese. (Big5 is both a character set and an
        encoding.) It is a superset of US ASCII. Non-ASCII
        characters are expressed in two bytes. Bytes 0xa1-0xfe are
        used as leading bytes for two-byte characters. Big5 and its
        extension is widely used in Taiwan and Hong Kong. It is not
        ISO 2022-compliant.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="refsect2" title="TIS 620">
        <a id="charsets-7_sect9" name="charsets-7_sect9" shape="rect"> </a>

        <h3>TIS 620</h3>

        <p>TIS 620 is a Thai national standard character set and a
        superset of US ASCII. Like ISO 8859 series, Thai characters
        are mapped into 0xa1-0xfe. TIS 620 is the only commonly
        used character set under Linux besides UTF-8 to have
        combining characters.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="refsect2" title="UNICODE">
        <a id="charsets-7_sect10" name="charsets-7_sect10" shape="rect"> </a>

        <h3>UNICODE</h3>

        <p>Unicode (ISO 10646) is a standard which aims to
        unambiguously represent every character in every human
        language. Unicode's structure permits 20.1 bits to encode
        every character. Since most computers don't include
        20.1-bit integers, Unicode is usually encoded as 32-bit
        integers internally and either a series of 16-bit integers
        (UTF-16) (needing two 16-bit integers only when encoding
        certain rare characters) or a series of 8-bit bytes
        (UTF-8). Information on Unicode is available at
        &lt;<a class="literalurl" href="http://www.unicode.org" target="_top" shape="rect">http://www.unicode.org</a>&gt;.</p>

        <p>Linux represents Unicode using the 8-bit Unicode
        Transformation Format (UTF-8). UTF-8 is a variable length
        encoding of Unicode. It uses 1 byte to code 7 bits, 2 bytes
        for 11 bits, 3 bytes for 16 bits, 4 bytes for 21 bits, 5
        bytes for 26 bits, 6 bytes for 31 bits.</p>

        <p>Let 0,1,x stand for a zero, one, or arbitrary bit. A
        byte 0xxxxxxx stands for the Unicode 00000000 0xxxxxxx
        which codes the same symbol as the ASCII 0xxxxxxx. Thus,
        ASCII goes unchanged into UTF-8, and people using only
        ASCII do not notice any change: not in code, and not in
        file size.</p>

        <p>A byte 110xxxxx is the start of a 2-byte code, and
        110xxxxx 10yyyyyy is assembled into 00000xxx xxyyyyyy. A
        byte 1110xxxx is the start of a 3-byte code, and 1110xxxx
        10yyyyyy 10zzzzzz is assembled into xxxxyyyy yyzzzzzz.
        (When UTF-8 is used to code the 31-bit ISO 10646 then this
        progression continues up to 6-byte codes.)</p>

        <p>For most people who use ISO-8859 character sets, this
        means that the characters outside of ASCII are now coded
        with two bytes. This tends to expand ordinary text files by
        only one or two percent. For Russian or Greek users, this
        expands ordinary text files by 100%, since text in those
        languages is mostly outside of ASCII. For Japanese users
        this means that the 16-bit codes now in common use will
        take three bytes. While there are algorithmic conversions
        from some character sets (esp. ISO-8859-1) to Unicode,
        general conversion requires carrying around conversion
        tables, which can be quite large for 16-bit codes.</p>

        <p>Note that UTF-8 is self-synchronizing: 10xxxxxx is a
        tail, any other byte is the head of a code. Note that the
        only way ASCII bytes occur in a UTF-8 stream, is as
        themselves. In particular, there are no embedded NULs
        ('\0') or '/'s that form part of some larger code.</p>

        <p>Since ASCII, and, in particular, NUL and '/', are
        unchanged, the kernel does not notice that UTF-8 is being
        used. It does not care at all what the bytes it is handling
        stand for.</p>

        <p>Rendering of Unicode data streams is typically handled
        through "subfont" tables which map a subset of Unicode to
        glyphs. Internally the kernel uses Unicode to describe the
        subfont loaded in video RAM. This means that in UTF-8 mode
        one can use a character set with 512 different symbols.
        This is not enough for Japanese, Chinese and Korean, but it
        is enough for most other purposes.</p>

        <p>At the current time, the console driver does not handle
        combining characters. So Thai, Sioux and any other script
        needing combining characters can't be handled on the
        console.</p>

      <div class="refsect2" title="ISO 2022 and ISO 4873">
        <a id="charsets-7_sect11" name="charsets-7_sect11" shape="rect"> </a>

        <h3>ISO 2022 and ISO 4873</h3>

        <p>The ISO 2022 and 4873 standards describe a font-control
        model based on VT100 practice. This model is (partially)
        supported by the Linux kernel and by <span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">xterm</span>(1)</span>. It is popular in
        Japan and Korea.</p>

        <p>There are 4 graphic character sets, called G0, G1, G2
        and G3, and one of them is the current character set for
        codes with high bit zero (initially G0), and one of them is
        the current character set for codes with high bit one
        (initially G1). Each graphic character set has 94 or 96
        characters, and is essentially a 7-bit character set. It
        uses codes either 040-0177 (041-0176) or 0240-0377
        (0241-0376). G0 always has size 94 and uses codes
        041-0176.</p>

        <p>Switching between character sets is done using the shift
        functions <code class="literal">^N</code> (SO or LS1),
        <code class="literal">^O</code> (SI or LS0), ESC n (LS2),
        ESC o (LS3), ESC N (SS2), ESC O (SS3), ESC ~ (LS1R), ESC }
        (LS2R), ESC | (LS3R). The function LS<em class="replaceable"><code>n</code></em> makes character set
        G<em class="replaceable"><code>n</code></em> the current
        one for codes with high bit zero. The function LS<em class="replaceable"><code>n</code></em>R makes character set
        G<em class="replaceable"><code>n</code></em> the current
        one for codes with high bit one. The function SS<em class="replaceable"><code>n</code></em> makes character set
        G<em class="replaceable"><code>n</code></em> (<em class="replaceable"><code>n</code></em>=2 or 3) the current one
        for the next character only (regardless of the value of its
        high order bit).</p>

        <p>A 94-character set is designated as G<em class="replaceable"><code>n</code></em> character set by an
        escape sequence ESC ( xx (for G0), ESC ) xx (for G1), ESC *
        xx (for G2), ESC + xx (for G3), where xx is a symbol or a
        pair of symbols found in the ISO 2375 International
        Register of Coded Character Sets. For example, ESC ( @
        selects the ISO 646 character set as G0, ESC ( A selects
        the UK standard character set (with pound instead of number
        sign), ESC ( B selects ASCII (with dollar instead of
        currency sign), ESC ( M selects a character set for African
        languages, ESC ( ! A selects the Cuban character set, etc.
        etc.</p>

        <p>A 96-character set is designated as G<em class="replaceable"><code>n</code></em> character set by an
        escape sequence ESC − xx (for G1), ESC . xx (for G2)
        or ESC / xx (for G3). For example, ESC − G selects
        the Hebrew alphabet as G1.</p>

        <p>A multibyte character set is designated as G<em class="replaceable"><code>n</code></em> character set by an
        escape sequence ESC $ xx or ESC $ ( xx (for G0), ESC $ ) xx
        (for G1), ESC $ * xx (for G2), ESC $ + xx (for G3). For
        example, ESC $ ( C selects the Korean character set for G0.
        The Japanese character set selected by ESC $ B has a more
        recent version selected by ESC &amp; @ ESC $ B.</p>

        <p>ISO 4873 stipulates a narrower use of character sets,
        where G0 is fixed (always ASCII), so that G1, G2 and G3 can
        only be invoked for codes with the high order bit set. In
        particular, <code class="literal">^N</code> and
        <code class="literal">^O</code> are not used anymore, ESC (
        xx can be used only with xx=B, and ESC ) xx, ESC * xx, ESC
        + xx are equivalent to ESC − xx, ESC . xx, ESC / xx,
        respectively.</p>
