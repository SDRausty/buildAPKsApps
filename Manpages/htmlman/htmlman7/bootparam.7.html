      <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

      <p>The Linux kernel accepts certain 'command-line options' or
      'boot time parameters' at the moment it is started. In
      general this is used to supply the kernel with information
      about hardware parameters that the kernel would not be able
      to determine on its own, or to avoid/override the values that
      the kernel would otherwise detect.</p>

      <p>When the kernel is booted directly by the BIOS (say from a
      floppy to which you copied a kernel using 'cp zImage
      /dev/fd0'), you have no opportunity to specify any
      parameters. So, in order to take advantage of this
      possibility you have to use software that is able to pass
      parameters, like LILO or loadlin. For a few parameters one
      can also modify the kernel image itself, using rdev, see
      <span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">rdev</span>(8)</span> for further
      details.</p>

      <p>The LILO program (LInux LOader) written by Werner
      Almesberger is the most commonly used. It has the ability to
      boot various kernels, and stores the configuration
      information in a plain text file. (See <span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">lilo</span>(8)</span> and <span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">lilo.conf</span>(5)</span>.) LILO can boot
      DOS, OS/2, Linux, FreeBSD, UnixWare, etc., and is quite
      flexible.</p>

      <p>The other commonly used Linux loader is 'LoadLin' which is
      a DOS program that has the capability to launch a Linux
      kernel from the DOS prompt (with boot-args) assuming that
      certain resources are available. This is good for people that
      want to launch Linux from DOS.</p>

      <p>It is also very useful if you have certain hardware which
      relies on the supplied DOS driver to put the hardware into a
      known state. A common example is 'SoundBlaster Compatible'
      sound cards that require the DOS driver to twiddle a few
      mystical registers to put the card into a SB compatible mode.
      Booting DOS with the supplied driver, and then loading Linux
      from the DOS prompt with loadlin avoids the reset of the card
      that happens if one rebooted instead.</p>

      <div class="refsect2" title="The Argument List">
        <a id="bootparam-7_sect2" name="bootparam-7_sect2" shape="rect"> </a>

        <h3>The Argument List</h3>

        <p>The kernel command line is parsed into a list of strings
        (boot arguments) separated by spaces. Most of the boot args
        take the form of:</p>

        <div class="itemizedlist">
          <ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
            <li class="listitem">
              <p>name[=value_1][,value_2]...[,value_10]</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p>where 'name' is a unique keyword that is used to
        identify what part of the kernel the associated values (if
        any) are to be given to. Note the limit of 10 is real, as
        the present code only handles 10 comma separated parameters
        per keyword. (However, you can reuse the same keyword with
        up to an additional 10 parameters in unusually complicated
        situations, assuming the setup function supports it.)</p>

        <p>Most of the sorting goes on in linux/init/main.c. First,
        the kernel checks to see if the argument is any of the
        special arguments 'root=', 'nfsroot=', 'nfsaddrs=', 'ro',
        'rw', 'debug' or 'init'. The meaning of these special
        arguments is described below.</p>

        <p>Then it walks a list of setup functions (contained in
        the bootsetups array) to see if the specified argument
        string (such as 'foo') has been associated with a setup
        function ('foo_setup()') for a particular device or part of
        the kernel. If you passed the kernel the line foo=3,4,5,6
        then the kernel would search the bootsetups array to see if
        'foo' was registered. If it was, then it would call the
        setup function associated with 'foo' (foo_setup()) and hand
        it the arguments 3, 4, 5 and 6 as given on the kernel
        command line.</p>

        <p>Anything of the form 'foo=bar' that is not accepted as a
        setup function as described above is then interpreted as an
        environment variable to be set. A (useless?) example would
        be to use 'TERM=vt100' as a boot argument.</p>

        <p>Any remaining arguments that were not picked up by the
        kernel and were not interpreted as environment variables
        are then passed onto process one, which is usually the init
        program. The most common argument that is passed to the
        init process is the word 'single' which instructs init to
        boot the computer in single user mode, and not launch all
        the usual daemons. Check the manual page for the version of
        init installed on your system to see what arguments it
        accepts.</p>

              show up when used in 32 bit protected mode. For
              example, some of the early ULSI-387 chips would cause
              solid lockups while performing floating-point
              calculations. Using the 'no387' boot arg causes Linux
              to ignore the maths coprocessor even if you have one.
              Of course you must then have your kernel compiled
              with math emulation support!</p>

              <p>(Only when <em class="replaceable"><code>CONFIG_BUGi386</code></em> is

              problem with the 'hlt' instruction, in that they
              can't reliably return to operating mode after this
              instruction is used. Using the 'no-hlt' instruction
              tells Linux to just run an infinite loop when there
              is nothing else to do, and to not halt the CPU. This
              allows people with these broken chips to use
              Linux.</p>
            </dd>

            <dt><span class="term">'root=...'</span></dt>

            <dd>
              <p>This argument tells the kernel what device is to
              be used as the root file system while booting. The
              default of this setting is determined at compile
              time, and usually is the value of the root device of
              the system that the kernel was built on. To override
              this value, and select the second floppy drive as the
              root device, one would use 'root=/dev/fd1'. (The root
              device can also be set using <span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">rdev</span>(8)</span>.)</p>

              <p>The root device can be specified symbolically or
              numerically. A symbolic specification has the form
              /dev/XXYN, where XX designates the device type ('hd'
              for ST-506 compatible hard disk, with Y in 'a'-'d';
              'sd' for SCSI compatible disk, with Y in 'a'-'e';
              'ad' for Atari ACSI disk, with Y in 'a'-'e', 'ez' for
              a Syquest EZ135 parallel port removable drive, with
              Y='a', 'xd' for XT compatible disk, with Y either 'a'
              or 'b'; 'fd' for floppy disk, with Y the floppy drive
              number — fd0 would be the DOS 'A:' drive, and
              fd1 would be 'B:'), Y the driver letter or number,
              and N the number (in decimal) of the partition on
              this device (absent in the case of floppies). Recent
              kernels allow many other types, mostly for CD-ROMs:
              nfs, ram, scd, mcd, cdu535, aztcd, cm206cd, gscd,
              sbpcd, sonycd, bpcd. (The type nfs specifies a net
              boot; ram refers to a ram disk.)</p>

              <p>Note that this has nothing to do with the
              designation of these devices on your file system. The
              '/dev/' part is purely conventional.</p>

              <p>The more awkward and less portable numeric
              specification of the above possible root devices in
              major/minor format is also accepted. (E.g., /dev/sda3
              is major 8, minor 3, so you could use 'root=0x803' as
              an alternative.)</p>

            <dd>
              <p>The 'ro' option tells the kernel to mount the root
              file system as 'read-only' so that file system
              consistency check programs (fsck) can do their work
              on a quiescent file system. No processes can write to
              files on the file system in question until it is
              'remounted' as read/write capable, for example, by
              'mount −w −n −o remount /'. (See
              also <a class="link" href="../htmlman8/mount.8.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">mount</span>(8)</span></a>.)</p>

              <p>The 'rw' option tells the kernel to mount the root
              file system read/write. This is the default.</p>

              <p>The choice between read-only and read/write can
              also be set using <span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">rdev</span>(8)</span>.</p>

              <p>This is used to protect I/O port regions from
              probes. The form of the command is:</p>

              <p><em class="replaceable"><code>reserve=</code></em><em class="replaceable"><code>iobase,extent[,iobase,extent]...</code></em></p>

              <p>In some machines it may be necessary to prevent
              device drivers from checking for devices
              (auto-probing) in a specific region. This may be
              because of hardware that reacts badly to the probing,
              or hardware that would be mistakenly identified, or
              merely hardware you don't want the kernel to
              initialize.</p>

              <p>The reserve boot-time argument specifies an I/O
              port region that shouldn't be probed. A device driver
              will not probe a reserved region, unless another boot
              argument explicitly specifies that it do so.</p>

              <p>For example, the boot line</p>

              <p>reserve=0x300,32 blah=0x300</p>

              <p>keeps all device drivers except the driver for
              'blah' from probing 0x300−0x31f.</p>

              <p>The BIOS call defined in the PC specification that
              returns the amount of installed memory was only
              designed to be able to report up to 64MB. Linux uses
              this BIOS call at boot to determine how much memory
              is installed. If you have more than 64MB of RAM
              installed, you can use this boot arg to tell Linux
              how much memory you have. The value is in decimal or
              hexadecimal (prefix 0x), and the suffixes 'k' (times
              1024) or 'M' (times 1048576) can be used. Here is a
              quote from Linus on usage of the 'mem='

                  it, it will crash horribly sooner or later. The
                  parameter indicates the highest addressable RAM
                  address, so 'mem=0x1000000' means you have 16MB
                  of memory, for example. For a 96MB machine this

                          also true: some chipsets will map the

        <h3>Boot Arguments for Ramdisk Use</h3>

        <p>(Only if the kernel was compiled with <code class="constant">CONFIG_BLK_DEV_RAM</code>.) In general it is a
        bad idea to use a ramdisk under Linux — the system
        will use available memory more efficiently itself. But
        while booting (or while constructing boot floppies) it is
        often useful to load the floppy contents into a ramdisk.
        One might also have a system in which first some modules
        (for file system or hardware) must be loaded before the
        main disk can be accessed.</p>

        <p>In Linux 1.3.48, ramdisk handling was changed
        drastically. Earlier, the memory was allocated statically,
        and there was a 'ramdisk=N' parameter to tell its size.
        (This could also be set in the kernel image at compile
        time, or by use of <span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">rdev</span>(8)</span>.) These days ram
        disks use the buffer cache, and grow dynamically. For a lot
        of information (e.g., how to use <span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">rdev</span>(8)</span> in conjunction with
        the new ramdisk setup), see <code class="filename">/usr/src/linux/Documentation/ramdisk.txt</code>.</p>

        <p>There are four parameters, two boolean and two
        integral.</p>

              When this feature is enabled, the boot process will
              load the kernel and an initial ramdisk; then the
              kernel converts initrd into a "normal" ramdisk, which
              is mounted read-write as root device; then /linuxrc
              is executed; afterward the "real" root file system is

              /initrd; finally the usual boot sequence (e.g.,

        <h3>Boot Arguments for SCSI Devices</h3>

        <p>General notation for this section:</p>

        <p><em class="replaceable"><code>iobase</code></em> -- the
        first I/O port that the SCSI host occupies. These are
        specified in hexadecimal notation, and usually lie in the
        range from 0x200 to 0x3ff.</p>

        <p><em class="replaceable"><code>irq</code></em> -- the
        hardware interrupt that the card is configured to use.
        Valid values will be dependent on the card in question, but
        will usually be 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 15. The other
        values are usually used for common peripherals like IDE
        hard disks, floppies, serial ports, etc.</p>

        <p><em class="replaceable"><code>scsi-id</code></em> -- the
        ID that the host adapter uses to identify itself on the
        SCSI bus. Only some host adapters allow you to change this
        value, as most have it permanently specified internally.
        The usual default value is 7, but the Seagate and Future
        Domain TMC-950 boards use 6.</p>

        <p><em class="replaceable"><code>parity</code></em> --
        whether the SCSI host adapter expects the attached devices
        to supply a parity value with all information exchanges.
        Specifying a one indicates parity checking is enabled, and
        a zero disables parity checking. Again, not all adapters
        will support selection of parity behavior as a boot
        argument.</p>

        <div class="variablelist">
          <dl>
            <dt><span class="term">'max_scsi_luns=...'</span></dt>

            <dd>
              <p>A SCSI device can have a number of 'subdevices'
              contained within itself. The most common example is
              one of the new SCSI CD-ROMs that handle more than one
              disk at a time. Each CD is addressed as a 'Logical
              Unit Number' (LUN) of that particular device. But
              most devices, such as hard disks, tape drives and
              such are only one device, and will be assigned to LUN
              zero.</p>

              <p>Some poorly designed SCSI devices cannot handle
              being probed for LUNs not equal to zero. Therefore,
              if the compile-time flag <code class="constant">CONFIG_SCSI_MULTI_LUN</code> is not set,
              newer kernels will by default only probe LUN
              zero.</p>

              <p>To specify the number of probed LUNs at boot, one
              enters 'max_scsi_luns=n' as a boot arg, where n is a
              number between one and eight. To avoid problems as
              described above, one would use n=1 to avoid upsetting
              such broken devices.</p>

              <p>Some boot time configuration of the SCSI tape
              driver can be achieved by using the following:</p>

              <p><em class="replaceable"><code>st=</code></em><em class="replaceable"><code>buf_size[,write_threshold[,max_bufs]]</code></em></p>

              <p>The first two numbers are specified in units of
              kB. The default <em class="replaceable"><code>buf_size</code></em> is 32kB, and
              the maximum size that can be specified is a
              ridiculous 16384kB. The <em class="replaceable"><code>write_threshold</code></em> is
              the value at which the buffer is committed to tape,
              with a default value of 30kB. The maximum number of
              buffers varies with the number of drives detected,
              and has a default of two. An example usage would
              be:</p>

              <p>The probe code for these SCSI hosts looks for an
              installed BIOS, and if none is present, the probe
              will not find your card. Then you will have to use a
              boot arg of the form:</p>

              level.</p>

              <p>All the parameters are as described at the top of
              this section, and the <em class="replaceable"><code>reconnect</code></em> value will
              allow device disconnect/reconnect if a nonzero value
              is used. An example usage is as follows:</p>

              <p>aha152x=0x340,11,7,1</p>

              <p>Note that the parameters must be specified in
              order, meaning that if you want to specify a parity
              setting, then you will have to specify an iobase,

              <p>The <em class="replaceable"><code>buson</code></em>, <em class="replaceable"><code>busoff</code></em> values refer

              so that other cards (such as an ISA LANCE Ethernet

        <p>Different drivers make use of different parameters, but
        they all at least share having an IRQ, an I/O port base
        value, and a name. In its most generic form, it looks
        something like this:</p>

        <div class="itemizedlist">
          <ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
            <li class="listitem">
              <p>ether=irq,iobase[,param_1[,...param_8]],name</p>
            </li>

            <li class="listitem">
              <p>The first nonnumeric argument is taken as the
              name. The param_n values (if applicable) usually have
              different meanings for each different card/driver.
              Typical param_n values are used to specify things
              like shared memory address, interface selection, DMA
              channel and the like.</p>

              <p>The most common use of this parameter is to force
              probing for a second ethercard, as the default is to
              only probe for one. This can be accomplished with a
              simple:</p>
            </li>

            <li class="listitem">
              <p>ether=0,0,eth1</p>
            </li>

            <li class="listitem">
              <p>Note that the values of zero for the IRQ and I/O
              base in the above example tell the driver(s) to
              autoprobe.</p>

              <p>The Ethernet-HowTo has extensive documentation on
              using multiple cards and on the card/driver-specific
              implementation of the param_n values where used.
              Interested readers should refer to the section in
              that document on their particular card.</p>

              <p>If this option is used, it should have precisely
              six parameters. Syntax:</p>

              <p>

              <p>The parameters maybe given as integers, or as
              strings. If strings are used, then iobase and membase
              should be given in hexadecimal. The integer arguments
              (fewer may be given) are in order: status (Enable(1)
              or Disable(0) this card), type (PC/Xi(0), PC/Xe(1),
              PC/Xeve(2), PC/Xem(3)), altpin (Enable(1) or

              (number of ports on this card), iobase (I/O Port
              where card is configured (in HEX)), membase (base of

              if you don't want the printer driver to claim all

              For example, lp=none,parport0 would use the first

              the printer driver entirely, one can use lp=0.</p>
